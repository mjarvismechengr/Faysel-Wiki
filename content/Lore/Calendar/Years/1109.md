## Overview

The current year.

To most of the world, 1109 is unremarkable. Kingdoms rise and fall slowly, borders shift by inches, and daily life continues much as it has for generations. No universally recognized catastrophe or miracle defines the year. It has not yet earned a name.

For historians and chroniclers, it remains unwritten.

Events of consequence are still unfolding.
