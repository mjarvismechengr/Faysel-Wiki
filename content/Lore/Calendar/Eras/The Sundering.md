## Overview

The Sundering began with the death of **Ukaleq**, god of death and the afterlife.

Driven by paranoia and fractured perception, [[Komaku]] killed Ukaleq, an act subtly instigated by [[Asmodeus]]. The death of a god shattered the divine order and sent shockwaves through reality itself. Immortality failed. Time became meaningful. The gods withdrew from the world in grief and fear.

Ukaleq later spoke from beyond, revealing death not as annihilation, but as necessity. He was restored not to life, but to purpose, becoming the eternal steward of souls. From that moment on, mortals were born mortal, and death became part of the natural order.

Fearing that the world of the Age of Wonder was too entrenched to change, the gods forged [[Manai]], a divine weapon of destruction. Manai razed immortal civilizations and shattered what could not be undone by mortality alone. In the chaos of this era, four mortals ascended to godhood, proof that the old rules no longer applied.

When the destruction finally ceased, the world was broken, emptied, and irrevocably altered.
