## Overview

The Post-Sundering Age is the present era. The gods no longer walk openly among mortals, and their voices are heard only through scripture, vision, and interpretation. Divine power still shapes the world, but at a distance, filtered through faith, institutions, and intermediaries rather than direct presence.

The wonders of the past survive only as ruins, relics, and half-understood legends. Towers built to last forever lie broken. Artifacts outlive the cultures that made them. Magic remains, but it is narrower, studied rather than assumed, powerful but rarely world-defining. What was once commonplace is now miraculous.

Since the Sundering, countless empires have risen and fallen. Borders have shifted, nations have collapsed, and entire civilizations have vanished with little more than a name in a damaged chronicle to mark their passing. War, famine, plague, and ambition have shaped history more than divine decree. Most people live and die within the concerns of their own generation, unaware that they walk atop the bones of ages.

To most, the Age of Wonder and the Sundering are distant myths, reduced to parables, festivals, or disputed theology. They are stories told to explain why the world is imperfect, or why death exists at all. To scholars, cultists, and those who dig too deeply, they are unfinished business. Old powers still stir in forgotten places. Ancient designs still seek completion.

The world has moved on, but it has not healed. The scars remain, buried just beneath the surface, waiting for the curious, the desperate, or the foolish to uncover them.
