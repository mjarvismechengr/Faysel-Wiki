## Overview

The Age of Wonder was the longest and most transformative era in recorded history.

During this time, the gods walked openly among mortals. They taught, ruled, warred, and loved in the physical world. Mortals themselves were effectively immortal, dying only through violence, catastrophe, or divine intervention. Age, sickness, and decay did not yet exist as natural forces.

Magic and technology flourished together rather than competing. Cities of impossible scale were raised. Flying citadels crossed the skies. Constructs, living machines, and arcane engines reshaped warfare, labor, and art. Knowledge accumulated rather than being lost, and civilizations planned not for generations, but for eternity.

This era produced the greatest wonders and the greatest hubris. Empires rose that believed themselves equal to the gods. Mortals challenged divine authority, not always unsuccessfully. The seeds of catastrophe were sown not through ignorance, but through confidence. When nothing dies naturally, consequences take far longer to arrive.

Much of what survives from the Age of Wonder exists only as ruins, artifacts, and half-deciphered texts. Modern scholars know it as a golden age, but the few surviving divine accounts suggest it was also an age of growing instability.
