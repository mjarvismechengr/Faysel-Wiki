## Overview

The Founding exists almost entirely in myth.

Stories claim this was the moment the world itself was shaped, when land, sea, sky, and the underlying laws of existence were first set into place. The gods were not yet rulers or patrons, but architects, shaping reality through conflict, cooperation, and intent. Mountains were raised as byproducts of divine struggle. Seas filled where blood and tears fell. Stars were set not only to light the heavens, but to watch the world below.

No mortal records survive from this era. Whether mortals even existed yet is unclear. What is known comes from creation myths, contradictory religious texts, and symbolic carvings found in ruins far older than any known civilization. Many cultures describe the same events using wildly different imagery, suggesting a shared truth filtered through belief.

To most people today, the Founding is a story told to children and priests alike. To scholars, it is a reminder that the world was not always stable, and that its foundations were laid by hands far more powerful than those who now walk upon it.
