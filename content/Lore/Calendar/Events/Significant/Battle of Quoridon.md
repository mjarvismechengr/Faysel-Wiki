## Overview

The Battle of Quoridon marks the final known advance of [[Manai]] during [[the Sundering]].

At the height of Manai’s devastation, [[Quoridon]] stood as one of the last great cities of the [[Age of Wonder]]. When Manai and his host of dragons reached it, the city did not fall cleanly. An immense earthquake split Quoridon apart, tearing open the earth beneath it. The sea rushed into the rupture, swallowing much of the city in a single catastrophic moment.

What followed is remembered only in fragments. Legends speak of a small band of mortals who confronted Manai amid the city’s collapse. Some accounts claim they slew him. Others insist they bound him, drove him away, or forced him to abandon the world once his purpose was fulfilled. No surviving record agrees on the outcome.

What is certain is this: after Quoridon, Manai’s destruction ceased.

Today, Quoridon is known as a lost city, its true fate obscured by time and ruin. To scholars, it represents the end of the Sundering’s greatest violence. To adventurers, it is a place where gods fell, or were made to stop.
