## Overview

The Battle of the Crimson Hills marked the end of the Warring Clans Era and the birth of the [[Shimazu Shogunate]].

For centuries before the battle, the isles were divided among feuding hobgoblin daimyō. Power shifted through siege, betrayal, and bloodshed, with no ruler able to hold dominion for long. This age of constant war forged hardened armies and ruthless leaders, but no lasting unity.

From this chaos rose [[Ryūnosuke Shimazu]], a general of exceptional discipline and strategic insight. Through a series of calculated campaigns known as the Unification Wars, he dismantled rival clans, binding some through oath and erasing others entirely.

The conflict reached its climax at the Crimson Hills, where Shimazu faced [[Harunobu Takeda]], the most powerful remaining warlord of the isles. Takeda’s cavalry was legendary, but Shimazu lured it into unfavorable terrain, breaking its momentum before engaging the enemy leader directly. Harunobu fell in single combat, and with his death, organized resistance collapsed.

In the aftermath, Ryūnosuke Shimazu declared himself Shogun. The surviving great clans bent the knee, swearing fealty to his line. The Shimazu banner rose over the isles, ending generations of open warfare and establishing a rule that has endured for over four centuries.

Though the shogunate brought stability, ambition did not die at the Crimson Hills. Beneath the banner of unity, the great clans continue to watch, wait, and sharpen their blades.
