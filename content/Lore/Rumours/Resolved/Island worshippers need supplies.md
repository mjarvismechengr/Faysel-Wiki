## Overview

[[Sanbalet]] let slip under pressure that one of his current clients is a group of worshippers operating on an island not far off the [[Siren Coast]]. They have been stockpiling weapons, armor, food, and magical goods, though no one seems to know why.

### Accuracies

- The island is [[Abbey Isle]], and it is extremely difficult to approach safely by sea.
    
- A group of religious zealots does occupy the ruins on the island.
    
- The group has been amassing weapons, armor, provisions, and magical materials over several months.
    
- They respond aggressively to intruders and do not permit outsiders to remain on the island.
    
- A black sapphire is indeed in their possession.
    
- Sanbalet has been supplying them with goods via smuggling runs.
    
- Keledek genuinely wants the sapphire and can open _Common Necromancy_ if he has it.

### Inaccuracies

- None
