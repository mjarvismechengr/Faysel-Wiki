## Overview

Since the aged alchemist’s unexplained disappearance some twenty years ago, the [[Alchemist's House]] has earned a grim reputation.

[[Seabrook]] Locals speak of three things above all else. First, reports of hauntings: shrieks in the night, strange lights in upper windows, and a sense of dread that drives people away before they cross the threshold. Second, rumors of hidden wealth, alchemical gold said to be concealed within the walls or floors of the house. Third, an old story claims that while the alchemist still lived there, a young messenger once emerged babbling about a grand library filled with forbidden tomes, including one that held the secret of turning base metal into gold.

### Accuracies

- The alchemist did disappear roughly twenty years ago, and no confirmed remains were ever recovered.
    
- Strange lights and sounds have been witnessed around the house, particularly at night.
    
- The house does contain remnants of alchemical work, including old notes, reagents, and damaged texts.
    
- A book claiming to describe the transmutation of base metals into gold did exist within the house.
    
- The structure has been deliberately altered to discourage exploration and create fear.

### Inaccuracies

- The house is not haunted. There are no spirits, undead, or lingering souls bound to the site.
    
- The eerie phenomena are the result of illusion magic and mundane tricks designed to frighten intruders.
    
- No alchemical gold exists anywhere in the house, nor was it ever successfully produced there.
    
- The transmutation text is fraudulent, either intentionally misleading or fundamentally flawed.
    
- There was never a grand library. Only a modest personal collection existed, most of which has since rotted, been looted, or rendered worthless.
    
- The current danger of the house does not stem from its former owner, but from its use as a front by [[Sanbalet]] and his smuggling operation.
