## Overview

During a recent cave-in in the mines beneath [[Fonbohr]], several miners were killed outright. [[Bronn Stonefist]] barely escaped with his life, suffering a crushed leg that left him with a permanent limp.

Since the collapse, Bronn has refused to return underground. He claims the cave-in was not an accident, insisting that something alive caused it. Most miners dismiss this as grief or trauma, but Bronn has quit the mines entirely and begun speaking openly about leaving Fonbohr to find a new purpose.

The incident has unsettled the town. Accidents happen in the deep, but miners have begun to whisper that the stone did not fall naturally.
