## Overview

[[Keledek]] advised [[Arthur Mourhan]] to seek rare alchemical ingredients in [[Marshfield]], specifically by speaking with the priests of [[Pestilina]] who maintain a temple there.

According to Keledek, the priests are knowledgeable in obscure reagents tied to disease, transformation, and preservation, and may be able to provide guidance or assistance unavailable elsewhere.
