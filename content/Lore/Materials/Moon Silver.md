## Overview

Moon silver is a rare celestial form of silver that originates from [[Castor's Eye]], falling to the world as small meteorites during stellar events, eclipses, or periods of heightened cosmic activity. Though visually similar to refined silver, moon silver often carries a faint inner glow when exposed to moonlight and resonates subtly with celestial magic.

Like mundane silver, moon silver can harm, repel, or bind certain creatures of corruption, particularly fiends, undead, and beings tied to curses or profane transformations. Moon silver greatly amplifies these effects. Weapons forged from it strike more reliably against supernatural foes, wards inlaid with it endure longer, and bindings crafted with moon silver are far more difficult for tainted entities to escape.

The metal is especially effective against creatures shaped or sustained by dark magic, blood curses, or soul-binding rituals. Some scholars believe moon silver does not merely wound such beings, but forces a brief alignment with the natural order, creating an internal conflict that weakens them.

Legends attribute moon silver’s potency to [[Castor]], claiming the metal carries an echo of his vigilance and the guiding light he placed in the sky. Whether divine blessing or cosmic coincidence, moon silver remains one of the most prized materials among hunters, templars, and enchanters who oppose the unnatural.
