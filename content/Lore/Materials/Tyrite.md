## Overview

Tyrite is a divine material used in the creation of several personal artifacts of the gods. It is formed from the crystallized sap of the [[World Tree]], drawn forth during moments of immense cosmic significance. In its natural state, tyrite appears as flowing bands of aurora-like light suspended within a translucent solid, as though the colors of the cosmos were frozen mid-motion.

Tyrite is inherently unstable in the mortal world. While the gods and certain exalted beings can handle it without harm, direct contact is extremely dangerous to mortals. Prolonged exposure causes severe burns, disorientation, and spiritual damage, as the material radiates raw divine and cosmic energy that mortal bodies are not meant to contain.

Artifacts forged from tyrite often blur the line between matter and concept. Such items may resonate with fate, time, or divine authority, and are frequently bound to the identity or will of their creator. Because of its origin and volatility, tyrite cannot be safely worked by mortal hands without extraordinary protections, rituals, or divine oversight.

Very little tyrite exists outside of the gods’ direct possession. Any fragment found in the mortal world is considered a relic of immense importance and a potential catalyst for world-altering events.
