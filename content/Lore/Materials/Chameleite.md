## Overview

Chameleite is a rare alchemical material prized not for innate magic, but for its exceptional receptivity to arcane energy. When used in crafting, it allows enchantments to bind more cleanly, endure longer, and carry greater intensity than they otherwise would. Artificers and enchanters value it as an amplifying medium, and one that does not impose its own will on magic, but instead magnifies what is placed into it.

In practical use, chameleite can substitute for many costly spell components, adapting itself to the arcane resonance required. This mutable quality is the source of its name. In more dangerous applications, chameleite may be refined into the substance known as [[Morphesium|Morphe]], a volatile arcane drug that heightens spellcasting at significant personal risk.

Raw chameleite is harvested from pulverized black marble quarried in the [[Black Marble Mountains]], where faint purple veins run through otherwise inert stone. In its raw state it is unstable and weakly reactive. Through controlled heating and purification, it can be transformed into a dark violet, glass-like material known as _refined chameleite_. In this form, its arcane conductivity increases dramatically. Enchanting slates fashioned from refined chameleite are legendary among artificers, an enchanting table capped with such a slate can reduce crafting time and failure risk substantially, and individual slates routinely sell for sums exceeding 20,000 gp.

According to ancient myth, chameleite’s origin predates modern magic. Legends claim it was formed when the blood of [[Calypso]] and [[Komaku]] mingled with the earth during their clash in [[The Sundering]]. Whether this tale is literal truth, symbolic allegory, or arcane exaggeration remains debated, but many scholars note that chameleite’s behavior resembles neither mortal alchemy nor divine relics entirely, as though it occupies an uneasy space between the two.
