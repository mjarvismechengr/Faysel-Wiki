## Overview
The goal of Dice Hydras is to grow the strongest hydra and devour the other player's hydras.

## Rules
Each player starts the game with a hydra with a d4 sized head. The first round begins with players rolling 1d4 and comparing totals. The player with the highest total roll wins, and if the winning players tie, those players reroll. When a player loses a round the next round they add a die of the same size (a hydra head) of their largest die to their rolled dice pool. When a player wins a round they increase the die size of one of their largest hydra heads by 1 (a d4 becomes a d6, a d6 becomes a d8, etc.). Rounds continue until a player wins by rolling 21+, or all other players fold.

> - If two or more players roll 21+ on the same turn, the higher of the two totals wins. 
>
> - If two or more players roll an equal 21+ total on the same turn, they enter a "Duel" which follows the same rules as before but each players rolls 1d4 +1d6 + 1d8 + 1d12 + 1d20.

- Once per game between rounds, after the betting stage a player can "sucker punch" an opponent, which automatically downsizes all hydra heads of the largest size by one size. (e.g. - a player whose hydra has 1d4 + 3d6 + 2d8 heads is sucker punched. Their hydra now has 1d4 +5d6 heads. If that player is sucker punched again on the same turn by a different player their hydra would then have 6d4 heads). This can be used to level the playing field or deny an opponent a chance at killing your Hydra. It cannot be done during a duel.

- A player can attempt to cheat by performing a sleight of hand check against (a set DC based on class of establishment or the other player's perception) A success grants a reroll of one die (must take the reroll).

### Betting
- No minimum bet 
- All Players make the same initial bet (at the beginning of the game), usually set by the class of establishment
- Winner takes the pot
- Between each round, each player has the chance to raise, call, or fold, with the maximum bet allowed in each round equal to the initial bet made by each player at the beginning of the game
