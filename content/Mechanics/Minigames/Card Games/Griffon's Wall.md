## Overview
Griffon's Wall is a black jack analog using dice (cards in game).

## Rules
The goal of Griffon's Wall is to get as close to 21 without going over while also rolling a higher number than the dealer. A player rolls 2d10 then adds up total (a roll of 1 can be 1 or 11). They can choose to stay, keeping their number, or "hit", rolling another 1d10 and adding it to their total. If a player's rolled exceeds 21 they "bust," and lose their bet. They also lose their bet if they roll less than 21 but not as high as the dealer. If the dealer busts, all players at the table win. If both dealer and player bust then the player "pushes" (doesn't lose their bet). If the dealer gets 21 all players lose. The dealer will hit until they have a hand of 17 or higher. 

### Betting
**Minimum buy in depends on locale:**

- Low End Casino: 5 gp
- Average Casino: 15 gp
- High End Casino: 25 gp

Payout is 3-2 ($3 won for every $2 bet = 150% of bet) or 1-1 if a player and the dealer both get 21.

### Example of Play 
4 Players join play. 

**Player A:**
- Bets 15 gp
- Rolls (1+6) = 7
- "Hits" and rolls 4, which is added to the original total of 7, (7+4) = 11
- "Hits" and rolls a 7, which is added to the previous total of 11, (11+7) = 18
- Player A decides to stay and waits to see dealer's result

**Player B:**
- Bets 15 gp
- Rolls (9+6) = 15
- "Hits" and rolls 9, which is added to the original total of 15, (15+9) = 24
- Player B busts and waits to see dealer's result

**Player C:**
- Bets 20 gp
- Rolls (11+10) = 21
- Player C gets a "Griffon's Wall" and waits to see dealer's result

**Player D:**
- Bets 35 gp
- Rolls (3+4) = 7
- "Hits" and rolls 9, which is added to the original total of 7, (7+9) = 16
- Player D decides to stay and waits to see dealer's result

> The Dealer then flips their cards (rolls 2d10) with a total of (6+4) = 10. They hit, and roll a 7 which is added to the previous total of 10, (10+7) = 17. They stay at 17. 

**Player A:**
- Rolled an 18 which is greater than dealer's 17, so Player A wins
- Player A wins back bet of 15 gp plus 22.5 gp in winnings

**Player B:**
- Busted which is an automatic loss except in the case of the dealer also busting, so Player B loses
- Player C loses their bet of 15 gp total

**Player C:**
- Rolled a "Griffon's Wall" which is an automatic win except in the case of the dealer also rolling a Griffon's Wall, so Player C wins
- Player C wins back bet of 20 gp plus 30 gp in winnings

**Player D:**
- Rolled a 16 which is less than dealer's 17, so Player D loses
- Player D loses their bet of 35 gp total
