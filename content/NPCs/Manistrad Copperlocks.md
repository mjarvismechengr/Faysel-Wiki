## Overview

Manistrad Copperlocks is a dwarven industrialist and councilor based in [[Seabrook]]. As head of the [[Tin Tunnels Mining Co.]], she oversees one of the most economically significant operations in the region, directing both the expansion of the [[Tin Tunnels Mine]] and the broader commercial interests tied to it.

Originally forged in more martial circumstances, Manistrad carries herself with the bearing of a veteran rather than a mere administrator. She is direct, pragmatic, and accustomed to command. Within her company, authority is clear and rarely questioned. Orders are expected to be followed, and disputes are resolved swiftly. Though her temper is controlled, it is not theoretical. Those who mistake her stature for softness are corrected quickly.

Her ambitions are not confined to the tunnels beneath the hills. As a sitting member of the [[Seabrook Town Council]], Manistrad is a vocal supporter of annexation by the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. She views Thranish governance as a stabilizing force that would secure the [[Shepherd's Highway]], protect trade caravans, and expand the market for silver and any deeper discoveries her miners might uncover. To her, prosperity and security are inseparable, and political alignment is a practical tool rather than an ideological stance.
