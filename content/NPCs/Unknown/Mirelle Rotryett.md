## Overview

Mirelle Rotryett is the ruling countess of [[Eldhollow County]] in the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]]. She governs one of the duchy’s most visible and strategically important regions, where river, road, and coast converge at the edge of the [[Endor Forest]]. Unlike some of Vaelwyth’s more storied figures, Mirelle attracts little attention beyond her domain, a fact that reflects both her temperament and her approach to rule.

Born into established but unremarkable nobility, Mirelle did not rise through war or royal favor. Her title is inherited, her legitimacy conventional, and her authority grounded in continuity rather than transformation. In a duchy shaped by threat and endurance, she represents steadiness rather than force.
