## Overview

Darius Velmor is the ruling count of [[Valenreach County]], presiding over one of the most visible and scrutinized regions in the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. His authority endures not because it is celebrated, but because it survived a moment when most did not.

During the [[War of the Fractured Crown]], Darius Velmor aligned with Duke [[Aren Varnis]] out of vassal obligation rather than belief. Valenreach’s support was cautious and limited, shaped by duty to the ducal hierarchy rather than ideological commitment. When it became clear the Crown would prevail, Velmor surrendered early and without resistance. That decision preserved his house, though it forever altered its standing.
