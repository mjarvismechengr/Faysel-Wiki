## Overview

Stenwulf Vael is the ruling Duke of the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]] and one of the most powerful political figures in the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. Known as much for endurance as for authority, Stenwulf governs a frontier duchy where law must be enforced daily against wilderness, raiders, and instability. His legitimacy rests not on spectacle or courtly favor, but on a long record of holding ground that others could not.

Of mixed heritage and raised along the forested borders of the realm, Stenwulf is often described as a frontier lord elevated to high station rather than a noble shaped by court life. He is deliberate, plainspoken, and difficult to unsettle, projecting an image of strength that comes from familiarity with danger rather than bravado. Within Thrane, he is widely regarded as the Crown’s most capable bulwark against threats emerging from the wild places of the world.
