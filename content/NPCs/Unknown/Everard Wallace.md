## Overview

Everard Wallace is the ruling count of [[Timber County]] in the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]]. He is best known as a veteran of the [[War of the Fractured Crown]], where he earned distinction as a young officer before returning to the forested frontier to assume his title. In a duchy defined by endurance and vigilance, Everard has come to embody a more romantic image of frontier nobility, one grounded in service, presence, and visible leadership.

Unlike many of Thrane’s younger nobles, Everard’s reputation was forged in action rather than inheritance alone. His conduct during the war secured both royal recognition and popular goodwill, and his return to rule Timber County after his father's death was seen not as a withdrawal from relevance, but as a deliberate choice to serve where duty was most demanding.
