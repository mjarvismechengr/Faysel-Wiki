## Overview

Arvidsjaur lies within the winding arms of the [[Dramsvol Fjord]] on the southern side of the [[Jotunspire Peaks]], where dark water narrows into still inlets and forest presses close against the shore. It serves as the principal settlement of the [[Dramsfjord Enclave]], positioned far from the fjord’s mouth and well beyond easy reach of coastal raiders. The location was chosen deliberately. The deeper one travels into the fjord, the narrower and more defensible the waters become, forcing any approaching fleet to slow and expose itself long before reaching the settlement.

The village stands at the edge of the [[Trollskog Forest]], where trees rise thick and close against the base of the mountains. Timber halls and longhouses are built from dense pine and reinforced with stone drawn from the nearby slopes. Structures are arranged in practical tiers along the shoreline and low hills, leaving open ground near the central gathering hall for councils, rites, and mustering warriors. Smoke from hearth fires drifts low beneath the canopy, often mingling with the mist that settles in the fjord’s still air.

Arvidsjaur is not a town in the conventional sense, but it is permanent and deliberately maintained. Fishing vessels line the inner docks, and longships rest further inland along reinforced slips where they can be launched quickly if needed. Storage houses contain preserved fish, cured meats, and crafted goods prepared for trade in [[Grenevik]] or for provisioning war bands when the [[Dimaheim Horde]] calls its warriors to gather.

The settlement operates under the guidance of the matriarchal council of the Enclave, whose authority is both civic and spiritual. Their presence shapes the tone of the village. Decisions are measured, tradition is preserved, and disputes are resolved in council rather than through unchecked bloodshed. While strength remains valued, Arvidsjaur is known for restraint compared to some more zealous tribes of Dimaheim.

Children are raised with the expectation that they will learn to navigate fjord and forest alike. Elders pass down sagas of survival and loss, of raids launched and repelled, and of winters endured when food ran thin and tempers shorter still. Worship of [[Rodikar]] is present but not dominant. Offerings are made, duels fought, and warriors honored, yet the settlement’s identity is tied more to survival and kinship than to holy fervor.
