## Overview

The Twilight Glade lies deep within the northern reaches of the [[Endor Forest]], far beyond the limits of settled patrols and well-worn trade roads. Unlike the southern portions of the forest that brush against the authority of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]], the northern Endor remains effectively unclaimed, its interior governed only by terrain, weather, and whatever ancient forces still linger beneath the canopy. Within this vast and watchful wilderness, the Glade exists as a carefully guarded sanctuary rather than an openly marked settlement.

The approach to the Twilight Glade is neither direct nor obvious. Mist hangs thicker in this region of the forest, and natural landmarks seem subtly displaced, as though distance resists measurement. Ravines and pools interrupt straight passage, while towering trees knit their branches so tightly overhead that even midday light resembles dusk. Those unfamiliar with the forest often lose their bearings long before drawing near the enclave. Those permitted entry are usually guided by one of its rangers, or arrive only after following signs few others would recognize.

The Glade itself occupies a natural basin ringed by ancient growth and low ridgelines that shield it from wind and distant view. Reflective pools scatter across the forest floor, mirroring both sky and canopy. Bioluminescent fungi trace pathways through the undergrowth, casting a gentle lunar glow at night. Above, treehomes and observatories rise into the branches, their wooden spans connecting structure to structure in quiet harmony with the living forest.

At the center stands [[Luminara Spire]], a temple and observatory dedicated to [[Castor]]. From this vantage, the stars are charted and recorded with precision refined over generations. The location was not chosen at random. The basin’s natural alignment and limited horizon obstructions provide unusually clear sightlines to the night sky, making the Glade one of the most consistent celestial observation sites within Endor.

Though the Twilight Glade is hidden, it is not disconnected from the wider forest. Rangers patrol the surrounding territory, maintaining a quiet perimeter that discourages intrusion without advertising its presence. The enclave rarely intervenes in matters beyond its borders, but it remains vigilant against encroaching corruption, unnatural disturbances, or threats that might spread southward toward more settled lands.
