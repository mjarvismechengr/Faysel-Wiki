## Overview 

Faysel is a world shaped by cycles of wonder, catastrophe, and uneasy balance. Once defined by an [[Age of Wonder]] and divine presence, the world now exists in the long shadow of that greatness, its peoples rebuilding, exploring, and contending with forces that never fully disappeared.

In ages past, gods walked openly among mortals, shaping nations, waging wars, and bestowing artifacts of immense power. That era ended with [[The Sundering]], a world-altering event that severed the gods’ direct influence and left behind divine relics, shattered empires, and lingering scars upon the land. Since then, Faysel has been a world defined not by divine decree, but by mortal ambition, faith, and fear.

The continents of Faysel are diverse and culturally distinct, ranging from ancient kingdoms and mercantile city-states to jungles hiding forgotten civilizations and seas ruled by pirates and monsters. Though the gods no longer walk the world, their influence remains undeniable. Churches, cults, and philosophies shape daily life, politics, and warfare. Relics of divine origin still surface from time to time, drawing adventurers, scholars, and conquerors alike, and often heralding upheaval in their wake.
