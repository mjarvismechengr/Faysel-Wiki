## Overview 

Castor’s Eye is the sole moon of Faysel and one of the most universally recognized symbols of guidance, vigilance, and quiet wisdom. According to ancient myth, the god [[Castor]] tore out his own eye and set it into the night sky so that no traveler, sailor, or wanderer would ever be wholly lost in the dark. The moon is said to watch the world unblinking, a constant reminder that even in the deepest night, something still sees.

Legends tell that when Castor performed this sacrifice, his blood was flung across the heavens. These divine remnants became the stars and distant galaxies, forming the great celestial patterns studied by astronomers and Starguides alike. For this reason the stars are believed to carry fragments of his wisdom.

Castor’s Eye governs nocturnal travel and the rhythms of the night. Its phases are closely observed by sailors, scholars, and clergy, with certain alignments believed to heighten prophetic dreams, celestial magic, or moments of revelation. Shrines to Castor frequently align their architecture to frame the moon at specific times of year.

To the faithful, the moon is not merely a celestial body but a promise. Castor’s Eye stands as proof that the gods once bled for the world, and that even after [[the Sundering]], their sacrifices continue to guide those willing to look up and listen.
