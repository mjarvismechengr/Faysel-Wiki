## Overview 

The Tin Tunnels Mine is an active dwarven mining complex located a few miles east of the [[Shepherd's Highway]], set into the low hills north of [[Seabrook]]. Operated by the [[Tin Tunnels Mining Co.]], the site serves as both an industrial center and a fortified settlement, housing miners, engineers, guards, and their families within stout stone walls overlooking the surrounding land.

Despite its name, the mine’s primary export is silver. Rich veins discovered along the coastal cliffs transformed what began as a modest operation into a major economic engine for Seabrook. Ore is transported south toward town for refinement and trade, tying the mine’s fortunes directly to the stability of the Shepherd's Highway and the political future of the region.

The settlement itself reflects dwarven practicality. Barracks, storehouses, smelting facilities, and reinforced tunnel mouths are arranged with efficiency rather than ornament. Security is taken seriously, with guards posted both along the outer wall and at key shafts descending into the earth. Life at the mine is disciplined and structured, shaped by long shifts underground and the constant maintenance required to keep the tunnels stable. Expansion efforts have pushed deeper in recent seasons, driven by the belief that more valuable deposits lie beneath the existing seams. These efforts have not been without complication.
