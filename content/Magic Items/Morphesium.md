[[Morphesium]], more commonly known as "morphe," is a narcotic (usually illegal) sold across Faysel, and causes a head rush along with enhanced senses and magic. There are three colors of morphe, all of which are granular, glittering powder. It is derived from [[Chameleite]]. 

When a humanoid inhales a dose of morphe fumes as a bonus action, the user must succeed on a (DC 10) Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Psychic damage and becomes Poisoned for one hour on a failed save. On a successful save the humanoid takes half as much damage and is not Poisoned. If the saving throw is failed by 10 or more, the humanoid drops to 0 hit points. Upon a successful save, the user gains access to a Metamagic option that can be used on each of their turns for one hour; more benefits can be gained by smoking more morphe, but doing so increases the risk of an overdose, as the DC increases by 5 for each additional dose taken within one hour. The exact Metamagic granted is based on the color of the morphe. 

If 3 or more doses are taken within a week, the user becomes addicted. While addicted, the user must use at least 1 dose of morphe a day with the DC of the Constitution saving throw climbing by 1 for each dose taken. 

### Brown Morphe
Brown morphe is dark brown and has a texture similar to brown sugar. The smoke it produces when burnt has a fine herbal taste and is brown itself. 

Effects:
> When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours. If the affected spell requires concentration, you have advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

### Blue Morphe 
Blue morphe is an indigo color with the texture of thick table salt. The smoke it produces when burnt is electric blue and has an intensely sweet and sour taste. 

Effects:
> If you make a spell attack roll and miss, you can reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.

### Red Morphe 
Red morphe is a dark red with the texture of powdered sugar. The smoke it produces when burnt is pink and has a spicy and savory taste. 

Effects:
> When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can make the spell’s range 30 feet.
