Desert’s Eye is a small, perfectly smooth sphere of thick, clear crystal, cool to the touch and heavy for its size. Within its depths, faint distortions ripple like heat haze over distant dunes, as though the desert itself is trapped behind glass. Though compact, it radiates immense arcane authority, serving as a conduit and amplifier of magical will rather than a mere focus.

The artifact once belonged to [[Yupa|Lord Yupa]], a central figure in the coalition that brought down [[Manai]] at the dawn of the Sundering. Yupa rose from the wastes as a prophetic warlord and spiritual leader, uniting a hardened desert people through vision, discipline, and an unshakable sense of destiny. To his followers, the Desert’s Eye was not simply a tool of power, but a symbol of foresight and inevitability, a reminder that survival in the wastes favors those who see farther than others dare.

Legends claim the sphere sharpened Yupa’s perception as much as his magic, allowing him to anticipate turning points in battle and fate alike. Whether this insight came from the artifact itself or from the man who wielded it is still debated by scholars. What remains certain is that Desert’s Eye carries the weight of prophecy, conquest, and sacrifice, a relic of a time when mortal will briefly stood on equal footing with the gods.
