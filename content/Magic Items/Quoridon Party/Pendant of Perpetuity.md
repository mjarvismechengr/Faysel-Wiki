Pendant of Perpetuity is a masterwork relic centered on a large, flawless jacinth, crystal-clear and cold to the touch. The gemstone is clasped by a sculpted platinum hand, its fingers curved with deliberate gentleness rather than force. It hangs from a finely wrought chain of intertwined gold and platinum, twisted together so seamlessly that the two metals appear grown, not forged.

The pendant is a symbol of endurance and defiance against time itself. Its magic sustains the wearer’s body against injury, decay, and sickness, reinforcing the idea that survival is not merely luck, but persistence made manifest. Wounds close more readily, vitality returns with unnatural consistency, and the slow erosion of age is held at bay so long as the pendant remains worn. The effect is unmistakable and unsettling, as if time is being politely but firmly told to wait its turn.

The Pendant of Perpetuity was once “owned” by [[Bigsbee Runebane]], though stolen is the more accurate word. Bigsbee took it from his own company shortly before the fall of [[Manai]], looking for a big score. 

Among those who know its history, the pendant is often viewed not as a blessing, but as a burden. It offers survival at a cost, postponing endings rather than preventing them, and reminding its bearer that time, once released, always collects what it is owed.
