Stoppered Oasis is a humble-looking flask bound to an ancient and hidden desert spring, a place of shelter, healing, and life amid endless sand. Though small enough to carry at a belt and weighing little more than a waterskin, it is never truly empty. When shaken, it sloshes softly, as if remembering the oasis to which it is still tethered.

The magic of Stoppered Oasis is not abstraction or conjuration, but connection. The water it produces is drawn from a real place, a secluded healing oasis known only to a few and fiercely protected by tradition and secrecy. Each drink carries the clarity of shaded palms, cool stone, and quiet refuge, making it far more than a tool of survival. It is a promise that life endures, even in the harshest wastelands.

The flask once belonged to [[Yupa]], the desert-born leader who stood against [[Manai]] at the dawn of [[the Sundering]]. To Yupa, the Stoppered Oasis was both symbol and strategy. It represented mercy, endurance, and the belief that strength is sustained not only by conquest, but by care. In his hands, water became salvation, a way to preserve allies and people alike through war and scarcity.

Legends claim that the oasis itself still exists, unchanged by time, its waters glowing faintly with the same quiet light found in the flask. Some believe that as long as Stoppered Oasis remains intact, the oasis can never truly be lost. Others whisper that if the flask were ever shattered, the desert would reclaim that refuge forever.
