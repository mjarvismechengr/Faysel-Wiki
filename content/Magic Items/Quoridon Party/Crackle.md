Crackle, also known as the _Whip of Gomios_, is a relic from the [[Age of Wonder]] once wielded by [[Hank Watson]], a mortal who stood against impossible odds during[[the Sundering]]. Unlike many divine artifacts shaped for conquest or dominion, Crackle was born from motion, defiance, and joy.

Crackle is bound to [[Gomios]], a minor and now largely forgotten deity associated with freedom, wandering, and reckless courage. Gomios was never widely worshiped, favored instead by travelers, rebels, and those who refused to stay where they were told. As his worship faded, fragments of his essence endured, bound into objects meant not to rule, but to roam.
