Delver’s Duster is a well-worn adventurer’s coat once worn by [[Hank Watson]], designed for long days in forgotten ruins and narrow escapes from things best left buried.

The duster is cut from the cured hide of a jackalwere, its leather darkened and softened by age, oil, and use. Though finely crafted, it bears the marks of a life lived underground: scorched hems, repaired seams, and faint claw marks that were never fully worked out. When worn, it hangs with a natural weight that never seems to snag, drag, or catch, as though it instinctively avoids the hazards of tight corridors and ancient mechanisms.
