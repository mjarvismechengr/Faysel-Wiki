Dead Blow is a legendary warhammer forged by the dwarves of [[Gaulgrym]], created not as a symbol of rule, but as a declaration of mastery. From its first striking, it became tradition that the weapon would pass only to the greatest smith of each generation. Each bearer left their mark upon it, some through engraved runes or inlaid metals, others through subtle enchantments woven directly into the hammer’s balance and impact.

Despite its ornate appearance, Dead Blow was never allowed to become ceremonial. Jewels are set flush and reinforced, precious metals are folded into the structure rather than layered atop it, and every embellishment serves function as much as form. In the hands of a master, it strikes with perfect weight and intent, a tool that feels as natural on an anvil as it does on a battlefield.

Dead Blow dates back to the same age and fellowship that stood against [[Manai]] during the start of [[The Sundering]]. It was wielded by [[Bigsbee Runebane]].
