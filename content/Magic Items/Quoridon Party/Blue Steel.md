Blue Steel is an early experimental firearm crafted by [[Breena Silverthread]], dating back to the waning days of the [[Age of Wonder]]. While rudimentary compared to her later masterworks, it already shows the hallmark of her style: an elegant fusion of arcane theory and precise engineering.

The weapon is forged from folded dark blue steel, its surface polished to a muted sheen. Six rotating barrels form its core, each one individually etched with celeste sigils that glitter faintly when the weapon is handled. The grip is carved from pearl and bears its most unsettling feature: a magically engraved mugshot of its most recent victim, rendered in stark, lifelike detail. When the revolver claims a new life, the image subtly changes, overwriting the old face.

Blue Steel does not feel like a mass-produced weapon. It feels personal, deliberate, and slightly unfinished, as though Breena was still testing ideas rather than perfecting them.

## History and Legacy

Blue Steel was wielded by [[Hank Watson]], an adventurer and relic-hunter active during the cataclysmic events surrounding the Sundering. It saw use during the legendary confrontation with [[Manai]], where mortal ingenuity stood briefly on equal footing with divine destruction.

After that battle, the revolver vanished along with much of Hank’s story. Like many artifacts of the era, it slipped into myth as proof that mortals once dared to challenge gods not just with prayer or magic, but with invention.
