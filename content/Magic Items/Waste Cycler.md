Waste Cycler is a relic of desert warcraft and ruthless efficiency, forged by [[Yupa|Lord Yupa]] during the final years before [[the Sundering]]. To those who faced it, the weapon was not merely feared. It was final.

The rifle’s construction reflects the world that shaped it. Its deadwood stock is scorched, cracked, and sand-blasted smooth by years of exposure, as if the desert itself helped carve it. The long black barrel drinks in light rather than reflecting it, giving the impression of a weapon that does not announce violence so much as erase it. Waste Cycler looks archaic and alien at once, a fusion of brutal practicality and advanced design that feels out of place in any era after the Age of Wonder.

Among Yupa’s enemies, Waste Cycler earned a reputation as a weapon of erasure rather than slaughter. Where armies clashed and heroes fell, this rifle ended conflicts with a single, terrifying certainty. Targets struck by its signature orange ray were not merely killed, but reduced to dust, leaving no corpse, no trophy, and no remains for burial or resurrection. Entire warbands learned to scatter at the sight of its glow, knowing that courage offered no protection.

Philosophically, Waste Cycler embodied Yupa’s harsh creed. In the desert, nothing is wasted. What cannot survive must be broken down and returned to the land. The rifle was named not for cruelty, but for inevitability. Life, matter, and power all cycle forward, and those who stood against Yupa’s vision were simply accelerated along that path.
