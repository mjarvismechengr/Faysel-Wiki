Melody’s Muse is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]] and the personal lute of [[Thalia]]. It is the only true instrument among the divine relics, a living creation formed from woven vines, resonant wood, and natural magic. Its carvings shift and reshape themselves as it is played, reflecting the tone, emotion, and intent of the music.

In legend, Melody’s Muse does not simply produce sound. It awakens feeling. Songs played upon it are said to stir overwhelming inspiration, artistic brilliance, reckless courage, and unrestrained desire in all who hear them. Crowds have been driven to create masterpieces, fall in love, abandon fear, or tear down tyrants after a single performance. The lute does not command obedience, but it makes indifference impossible.

Since Thalia’s withdrawal from the world, Melody’s Muse has vanished. Some claim it appears only at moments of cultural collapse or rebirth, passing briefly into mortal hands before slipping away again.
