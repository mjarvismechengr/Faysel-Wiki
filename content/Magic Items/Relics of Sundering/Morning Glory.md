Morning Glory is the sacred morningstar of [[Solara]] and one of the [[Relics of Sundering]]. This weapon embodies the sun as light, revelation, and certainty. Its surface gleams with a steady, dawnlike radiance that never flickers or dims, warm to the touch but never burning.

In myth, Morning Glory reveals what hides in shadow. Lies unravel in its presence, illusions thin, and secrets grow difficult to keep. The light it casts is not blinding, but unavoidable, the kind that forces clarity rather than overwhelms. Those who wield it are said to feel their resolve sharpen, as hesitation and self deception are stripped away.

Solara used Morning Glory to end false rule and expose corruption. Tyrants fell not because they were burned to ash, but because their deceptions could no longer stand beneath the sun. Morning Glory represents the moment after illumination, when truth has been revealed and action becomes a responsibility rather than a choice.
