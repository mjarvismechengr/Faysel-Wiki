The Warden’s Take is one of the [[High Tide]], though unlike most relics, it was created during the Sundering itself rather than before it. It takes the form of a treasure chest, said to be bound to [[Manai]] and his vast hoard. The chest is mystically tied to the spoils left in the wake of his destruction. Gold, gems, and wealth taken from fallen cities and shattered empires are said to flow toward it over time. Those who possess the Warden’s Take become impossibly wealthy, as if fortune itself bends to ensure their coffers are never empty.

Legends describe the chest as a divine accounting of ruin. It does not create wealth from nothing, but gathers what was claimed by Manai’s wrath and left behind when the world broke. In this way, it reflects Manai’s nature. Destruction followed by possession. What survives annihilation belongs to whoever is strong enough to claim it.

Scholars compare the Warden’s Take to mythical objects of endless return, a symbol of wealth that renews itself without visible source. Unlike other relics tied to weapons or judgment, this one embodies aftermath. It is the quiet proof that devastation leaves profits behind, and that even the end of civilizations can be measured in coin. The current location of the Warden’s Take is unknown. Many believe it has been hidden deliberately, not out of fear of its power, but because unchecked wealth has a way of reshaping the world long after the fires die out.
