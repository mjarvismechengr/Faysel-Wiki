Worldshaper is the divine hammer of [[Cyra]], the First Creator and smith of the gods. It is not merely a weapon or a tool, but the instrument through which existence itself was first shaped. With Worldshaper, Cyra forged matter, defined form, and laid the foundations of family, lineage, and continuity across Faysel.

In myth, every strike of Worldshaper carried intent rather than force. Mountains were not smashed into being, but patiently formed. Stars were not hurled into the sky, but kindled like sparks from an anvil. The hammer embodies creation through purpose and care. Where other divine relics are remembered for the devastation they caused, Worldshaper is remembered for what it made possible.

During the [[Age of Wonder]], the hammer was rarely seen by mortals, though its echoes were everywhere. Legends claim that even fragments of its work still shape reality, from unbreakable bonds of kinship to places where creation feels unusually fertile or enduring. After [[the Sundering]], Cyra withdrew from the world, and Worldshaper vanished with her, its location unknown.

To scholars and relic-hunters alike, Worldshaper is considered the single most important artifact ever created. Not because it can destroy the world, but because it once made it, and might do so again.
