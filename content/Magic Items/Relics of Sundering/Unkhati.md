Unkhati is the personal bow of [[Nanuk]] and one of the [[Relics of Sundering]]. It is a massive hunting bow formed from wood, bone, and sinew, shaped as much by use as by craft. The bow is said to feel alive in the hands of a worthy hunter, its tension responding to breath, posture, and intent rather than brute strength alone.

Unkhati was wielded by Nanuk during his legendary hunt of the [[Kami]] of Faysel. Each draw of the bow was a test not just of aim, but of patience, awareness, and respect for the prey. Legends say Unkhati never loosed an arrow unless the hunt was honest. Shots taken in fear, cruelty, or arrogance would fail, no matter the skill of the archer.

The bow embodies the philosophy of the hunt. To wield Unkhati is to accept the full weight of the hunt, including failure, injury, and death. Victory is never guaranteed, only earned.

After Nanuk’s ascension, Unkhati vanished into the wilds. Some believe it waits for a hunter capable of surviving without comfort or command, one who understands that the greatest hunt is not against beasts or gods, but against the limits of one’s own endurance.
