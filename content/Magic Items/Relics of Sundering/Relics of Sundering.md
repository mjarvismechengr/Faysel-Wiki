## Overview 

Throughout their existence the gods have created artifacts of incredible power for their own use. Weapons capable of destroying civilizations, invulnerable armor, clothing to enhance personal traits to a supernatural level, and more. In the [[Age of Wonder]] the awesome potential of these personal effects were on full display, being used frequently as a boon or scourge to Faysel's people. These objects channeled part of the essence of the god to who they belonged and in time, often came to define a major part of a god's identity. 

During [[The Sundering]] the gods distanced themselves from Faysel, leaving their precious personal effects behind.  In a moment, the most powerful, world changing objects in history were simply up for grabs. Some were left to devoted followers, some hidden away, and others were simply left where last used. In any case, they instantly became the pinnacle achievement for any treasure hunter, and life goal of those hungry for power. Relics that were found changed hands frequently, as their continued use could not go unnoticed for long, and unsurprisingly attracted murderers and thieves. 

As time has passed, many relics previously found have been lost or hidden again and many more are forgotten or were never originally recovered. The location of very few of these legendary artifacts is currently known and their fame still inspires many to their lifelong pursuit.
