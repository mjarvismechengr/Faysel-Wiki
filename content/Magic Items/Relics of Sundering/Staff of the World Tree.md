The Staff of the World Tree is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]], the personal staff of [[Rambak]]. It is formed from living wood drawn from the World Tree itself, its surface braided with bark, leaf, and root that subtly shifts with the seasons. The staff radiates quiet vitality, warmth, and a deep sense of belonging rather than overt power.

In myth, Rambak uses it to bind land together after devastation, restore blighted forests, and reinforce the unseen connections between peoples, places, and living systems. When raised in anger, the staff can awaken roots, vines, and ancient growth to entangle, imprison, or slowly crush those who threaten the natural order or deliberately sever bonds of kinship.

The staff is said to anchor its bearer to the living world itself. While it is held, the land recognizes the wielder as part of its web, offering shelter, nourishment, and endurance. However, those who attempt to use it for exploitation or domination find it growing heavy, unresponsive, or actively hostile, rejecting hands that seek to take without giving.

Since [[the Sundering]], the Staff of the World Tree has vanished along with Rambak’s direct presence. Legends claim it rests somewhere roots still touch every corner of the world, waiting for a bearer who understands that true strength lies not in command, but in connection.
