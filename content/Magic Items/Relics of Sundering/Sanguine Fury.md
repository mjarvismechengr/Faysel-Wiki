Sanguine Fury is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]] and the personal weapon of [[Rodikar]]. It is a trident forged not merely as a tool of war, but as a perfect expression of combat itself. In myth, Sanguine Fury is said to respond to the rhythm of battle, resonating with the clash of steel, the roar of armies, and the heartbeat of those who fight without hesitation.

Unlike weapons that represent justice, protection, or divine authority, Sanguine Fury represents _earned power_. It is a symbol of leadership claimed through victory, not granted by birthright or decree. Wherever Rodikar planted the trident, wars were decided, thrones fell, and champions rose or died proving themselves.

During [[The Sundering]], Sanguine Fury became one of the most contested objects in existence. Kingdoms, warlords, and would-be gods waged centuries-long conflicts over rumors of its location, believing that whoever wielded it could not only conquer nations, but legitimize their rule through undeniable martial supremacy. Entire bloodlines were extinguished in pursuit of it.

After the Sundering, Sanguine Fury vanished. Some claim Rodikar hid it to prevent unworthy hands from wielding it. Others believe it lies buried beneath an ancient battlefield, still drinking the blood of those foolish enough to die near it. A darker legend claims the trident _chooses_ when it will be found, emerging only when a conflict worthy of it threatens to reshape the world.
