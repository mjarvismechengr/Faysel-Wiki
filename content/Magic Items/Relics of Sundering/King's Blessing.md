King’s Blessing is the crown of [[Cyrus]] and one of the [[Relics of Sundering]]. Unlike most relics, its location and bearer are publicly known. It rests upon the head of the reigning monarch of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]], currently King [[Lytharion Solmara]], as it has upon his ancestors for generations. Its continued visibility is not an oversight but a declaration. Authority bound by law has nothing to hide.

The crown is not a symbol of unchecked power, but of sanctioned rule. King’s Blessing affirms divine right only insofar as the wearer upholds justice, wisdom, and responsibility. It does not compel obedience through fear or awe. Instead, it sharpens judgment, clarifies intent, and weighs decisions with the quiet pressure of consequence. A just ruler finds the crown steady and reassuring. A corrupt one finds it heavy.

Legends say the crown does not grant power in the conventional sense. It reveals truth. Lies spoken from the throne feel wrong on the tongue. Oaths made lightly echo longer than intended. The wearer is constantly reminded that law exists to serve the people, not the crown itself. When a monarch rules unjustly, the crown is said to grow cold, its blessing diminished though never removed.

That King’s Blessing has not been stolen, hidden, or warred over is itself proof of its nature. It offers no advantage to tyrants, conquerors, or usurpers. Only those willing to rule openly and accept judgment alongside authority can truly claim it. In this way, King’s Blessing stands as Cyrus’s quiet challenge to all rulers. Power may be taken by force, but legitimacy must be earned every day.
