Swift Justice is one of the most legendary [[Relics of Sundering]], a blade whose name has become synonymous with inevitable judgment. It was the personal sword of [[Cyrus]], carried not as a weapon of war, but as the final answer to those who would not repent.

The sword was forged by [[Cyra]] as an act of devotion, shaped from [[tyrite]] and imbued with a fragment of Cyrus’s divine essence. Unlike many divine weapons, Swift Justice was rarely drawn. Cyrus believed law and restraint were stronger than steel, and the blade was unsheathed only when every other path to peace had failed. When it was raised, there was no escape from judgment.

Swift Justice came to embody everything Cyrus stood for: accountability, clarity, and finality. Legends claim it can cut through any material, mundane or divine, and that no unworthy hand can wield it. To grasp the hilt without Cyrus’s approval is said to bring ruin rather than power.

During [[The Sundering]], Cyrus withdrew from Faysel and entrusted Swift Justice to a mortal champion, tasking them with carrying law into a broken world. Since then, the blade has passed through many hands, always reshaping the fate of those who bear it and those who stand against it. Its presence never remains hidden for long.

Today, Swift Justice is lost. Its location is unknown, its last wielder unrecorded. Yet its legend endures across Faysel as a symbol of perfect law made manifest. To some, it is hope that justice can still prevail. To others, it is a reminder that judgment, once earned, is unavoidable.
