High Tide is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]], and the legendary harpoon of [[Iskandar]], god of storms, seas, and the lost. Known across Faysel by name and deed, it is widely regarded as one of the most powerful weapons ever forged.

High Tide was created by [[Cyra]], shaped from [[tyrite]] and kraken bone, and gifted to Iskandar as both weapon and symbol. With it, he struck down leviathans, shattered fleets, and pinned monsters of the deep to the ocean floor, channeling storms as easily as breath. In legend, no sea creature could escape its throw, and no storm failed to answer its call.

Stories agree on a few constant traits. High Tide can be hurled impossibly far, far beyond the reach of any mortal weapon, and it always returns to the hand of its rightful wielder. When cast, it carries the force of the sea itself, not simply piercing flesh, but delivering judgment through wind, wave, and pressure.

Since [[The Sundering]], High Tide has been lost. Most believe it still lies at the bottom of an ocean, embedded where Iskandar last struck a world-shaking blow. Sailors tell of strange storms and impossible tides near certain trenches, whispering that the harpoon waits, unmoving, until the sea has need of it again.
