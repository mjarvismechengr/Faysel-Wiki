The Ruby Rod is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]] and the personal implement of [[Asmodeus]], Lord of the Ninth and supreme ruler of the Nine Hells. More than a symbol of authority, the Rod is the physical focus through which Asmodeus enforces infernal law, binds contracts, and asserts absolute dominion over devils and damned souls alike.

Fashioned from a massive flawless ruby set into infernal metal, the Rod is said to embody the principles of Hell itself: order without mercy, obligation without escape, and power enforced through consent twisted into inevitability. In myth, every contract ratified by Asmodeus is sealed through the authority of the Ruby Rod, whether or not it is physically present. Devils bound by its power cannot disobey its bearer, and even archdevils are said to feel its weight like a chain around the soul.

The Ruby Rod is not a weapon of battlefield destruction, but of control. Where other divine relics shatter armies or reshape the world, the Rod reshapes _outcomes_. It compels obedience, enforces bargains, and renders rebellion meaningless once terms are set. Entire infernal hierarchies, treaties of the Blood War, and the structure of Baator itself are believed to be stabilized through its continued existence.

During [[the Sundering]], Asmodeus did not abandon the Ruby Rod. Unlike many divine relics left behind on Faysel, the Rod remains firmly in his possession, a constant reminder that Hell did not retreat with the gods. Its presence is one of the few certainties shared across planar lore: as long as the Ruby Rod exists, Asmodeus’s rule endures, contracts remain unbreakable, and tyranny wears the mask of law.
