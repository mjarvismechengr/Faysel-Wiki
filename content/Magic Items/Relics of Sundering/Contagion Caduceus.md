The Contagion Caduceus is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]], the personal staff of [[Pestilina]]. It is a tall, ancient rod wrapped in two living serpents coiled along its length. One carries the most potent venom ever known, capable of felling nations through plague and poison. The other carries the most powerful cure, able to arrest disease, neutralize toxins, and preserve life against impossible odds.

The staff embodies Pestilina’s central truth that poison and medicine are the same force viewed through intent and measure. Every affliction it delivers has a corresponding remedy held just as closely, and every cure is born from an intimate understanding of suffering. The Caduceus is not a symbol of mercy, but of control over the boundary between life and death.

In myth, Pestilina uses the Contagion Caduceus to seed plagues, test populations, and refine diseases into precise instruments, then later to halt outbreaks or grant immunity where survival proves instructive. It is said that no illness exists that the staff cannot create, and none that it cannot cure, provided the wielder understands the cost.

Since the Sundering, the location of the Contagion Caduceus is unknown. Many fear that its rediscovery would grant its bearer absolute dominion over health and decay, the power to decide who suffers, who adapts, and who survives.
