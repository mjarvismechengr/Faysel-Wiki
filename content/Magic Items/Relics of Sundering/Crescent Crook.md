The Crescent Crook is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]], the personal weapon of [[Castor]], god of the moon, stars, travelers, and vigilance. Forged of pure [[moon silver]], its crescent head reflects the moon’s unyielding gaze, a reminder that nothing born of darkness escapes notice forever.

In the oldest myths, he hunted demons, devils, and undead relentlessly, cutting them down when needed. But Castor understood a truth many gods ignored: slaying creatures of night rarely ends them. Fiends reform in their hells. Undead return through phylacteries, bindings, or forbidden rites. Killing them is often temporary. Watching them, binding them, and denying them freedom is lasting. The Crescent Crook was forged for that purpose.

In battle, the Crook was used to hook, bind, and restrain beings that could not be meaningfully destroyed, pinning them beneath the moon’s light and severing their ability to flee, hide, or reform. Devils were dragged screaming from shadows. Demons were chained mid-rampage and held until wards could be raised. Liches and death knights found their escape routes cut short, their darkness exposed and constrained.

To mortals and travelers, the Crook serves another role. It guides the lost, reveals hidden paths, and marks safe passage through uncertainty. Castor never abandoned the innocent while hunting the monstrous. The same relic that snares fiends also steadies wanderers, embodying his belief that vigilance protects both by watching the road and the roadside.

After the Sundering, the Crook vanished along with Castor’s direct presence. Yet moon silver wards, binding circles, and fiend-collars used by demon hunters are all said to descend from its design. Even now, creatures of the night speak its name with unease.
