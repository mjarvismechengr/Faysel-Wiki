The Cloak of Shadows is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]] and is attributed to [[Xalzotec]], serving as his personal mantle. It is woven from shadow itself, lightless and cold to the touch. Edges blur, folds swallow detail, and its surface seems to drink in torchlight rather than reflect it.

In myth, the cloak embodies concealment as dominion. When worn, it allows its bearer to pass unseen, unheard, and often unremembered, not merely hiding the body but eroding certainty itself. Witnesses doubt what they saw. Records grow inconsistent. Even divine senses are said to slide off the cloak unless focused with deliberate intent. It does not simply hide presence, it creates absence.

The Cloak of Shadows is closely associated with undeath, assassination, and forbidden rites. Xalzotec is said to have used it to move freely among mortals and gods alike, observing, whispering, and binding souls without ever fully revealing himself. The cloak favors patience and secrecy over open violence, empowering those who act from hidden places rather than the battlefield.

Since the Sundering, the cloak’s whereabouts are unknown. Stories claim it surfaces briefly in times of great paranoia or unexplained disappearances, worn by cult leaders, assassins, or undead lords who believe they command it. These figures rarely survive long. The cloak does not serve loyalty. It serves secrecy, and it abandons those who draw too much attention, leaving them exposed when silence fails.
