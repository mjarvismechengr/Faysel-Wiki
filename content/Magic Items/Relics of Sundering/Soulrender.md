Soulrender is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]] and is the personal weapon of [[Ukaleq]]. Its form is that of a massive macuahuitl, a broad executioner’s blade edged with obsidian-like soulglass. It is heavy, deliberate, and unmistakably final.

In myth, Soulrender is not a weapon of slaughter, but of severance. It exists to end what should not continue. Undead abominations, soul-bound entities, liches, death knights, and beings that refuse passage beyond death are its true targets. When Soulrender strikes, it does not merely destroy the body. It cuts the tether anchoring a soul to the world, enforcing the boundary Ukaleq safeguards.

Unlike weapons born of wrath or conquest, Soulrender is never described as swung in haste. Ukaleq is shown wielding it only at thresholds, crossroads, and moments where denial of death threatens reality itself. To the living, it is a warning. To the dead who linger, it is mercy through finality.

Since the Sundering, Soulrender has vanished along with Ukaleq’s direct presence. Legends claim it appears only in moments of grave imbalance, carried by silent figures at battlefields choked with undeath or at the fall of immortal tyrants who have overstayed their end. Those who seek it hoping for power over death never find it. Those who seek to end an abomination sometimes do, and rarely survive unchanged.
