Totem of Beast Friendship is a ritual tool once carried by [[Yupa|Lord Yupa]], reflecting a side of him often overlooked in stories of conquest and prophecy. Where his more infamous relics embodied annihilation and judgment, this totem represented coexistence, authority, and respect for the natural order.

The totem consists of two dense metallic spheres bound to a worn leather strip. When spun in a slow, practiced motion, the spheres emit a low, resonant hum that seems to vibrate through bone rather than air. Animals react instinctively to the sound. Predators hesitate, mounts steady their breathing, and even hostile beasts show signs of confusion or reluctant calm. Those familiar with the desert say the hum echoes the wind moving through deep canyon stone, a sound older than fear.

To Yupa, beasts were not tools or enemies, but forces of the world that demanded acknowledgment. The Totem of Beast Friendship allowed him to project dominance without cruelty, bending animal will through presence rather than pain. Among his followers, it was said that he could walk unarmed through stampeding herds or still the charge of a war beast with nothing but the spinning spheres and a steady gaze.

Legends claim the totem does not compel loyalty in the way chains or magic collars do. Instead, it enforces hierarchy. Animals influenced by it recognize the wielder as something greater in the natural order, a storm given flesh rather than a rival to be challenged. This distinction is why some druids and beast-speakers view the totem with unease. It does not speak to animals as equals. It commands them as inevitabilities command the land.

Since the Sundering, the Totem of Beast Friendship has become a quiet artifact, easily underestimated beside flashier relics of war. Those who do so tend to learn quickly that calming the wild can be far more dangerous than provoking it.
