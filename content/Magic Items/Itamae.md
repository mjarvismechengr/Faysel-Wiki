Itamae appears at first glance to be a finely balanced chef’s knife, forged from matte gray steel that fades to white in gentle, wave-like patterns toward the edge. Runes etched in gold run the length of the blade, precise and deliberate. Its ivory handle is intricately carved, depicting a fish being beheaded on one side and carefully flayed on the other, equal parts artistry and instruction. The sheath is made of dull black wood, inlaid with jade that depicts a stylized scene of battle, warriors frozen mid-strike.

When the command word _“sashimi”_ is spoken, the knife expands and reshapes into a large katana, bearing the same runic designs and balanced craftsmanship. Speaking the word again causes the weapon and sheath to return to their original, compact form, as though the blade itself understands restraint as well as excess.

Itamae once belonged to [[Flay Fieri]], a hobgoblin samurai who fought alongside the heroes that brought down [[Manai]] at the dawn of [[the Sundering]]. Flay was as devoted to cooking as he was to warfare, believing that preparation, respect for ingredients, and precision of the cut were sacred disciplines shared by both crafts. To him, the act of cooking was a form of meditation and honor, no different from drawing steel on the battlefield.

Flay Fieri’s philosophy left a lasting mark on [[Yoseju]]. Many elements of modern Yosejuan culture, particularly the reverence for culinary tradition, discipline, and ritualized craft, are attributed to his influence. Itamae stands as a symbol of that legacy, a blade that embodies the belief that creation and destruction are guided by the same steady hand.
