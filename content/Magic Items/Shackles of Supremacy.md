The Shackles of Supremacy are among the most feared relics to survive the [[Age of Wonder]], not for their spectacle, but for their purpose. These heavy manacles were never meant merely to restrain the body. They exist to erase defiance.

Forged to bind warriors, rulers, and champions, the shackles are said to ignore the usual boundaries of flesh and form. Ethereal beings can be dragged into submission. Divine entities can be made to bleed. When closed, the cursed chain does not simply hold a creature in place. It enforces obedience, suppressing power, will, and identity until resistance feels not just futile, but wrong.

The shackles are inseparably tied to [[Og'riq]], who used them to build an empire founded on domination rather than loyalty. Kings were chained and ruled in his name. Champions were broken and turned into instruments of conquest. Entire nations functioned as extensions of Og’riq’s will, their leaders bound either physically or spiritually by the Shackles of Supremacy.

Their use, however, carries a cost. The chains do not discriminate between master and captive. Each binding deepens their corruption, hollowing out the victim while also warping the wielder. Authority becomes addiction. Control becomes necessity. Over time, both sides are reduced to reflections of the same tyranny. The shackles do not create obedience. They consume autonomy until nothing remains but submission.

During the legendary wars between Og’riq and Daghor Malatok, the Shackles of Supremacy were wielded against undead generals, living sorcerers, and oathbound heroes alike. Their clash devastated large regions of Isomar and ended with Og’riq’s near destruction. Though his empire shattered and his power waned, the shackles were never destroyed. Like their creator, they endured.
