## Overview 

The Maru Desert is a vast sea of sand dominating the heart of [[Al'Dira]]. Endless dune fields, scorched stone plains, and sun-bleached horizons define the region, with distances measured in days rather than miles. The desert is shaped as much by wind as by heat, with dunes that migrate slowly across the landscape, burying roads, ruins, and entire settlements beneath layers of shifting gold.

Most of the Maru lies nominally within the borders of the [[Kingdom of Esjiq]], though true control extends little beyond the fertile corridor sustained by the [[Itum River]]. Away from the river’s reach, authority fades quickly. Patrols are rare, borders are symbolic, and the desert answers only to time, sun, and sand.

The climate is brutal and unforgiving. Days are searingly hot, nights plunge into biting cold, and sandstorms can rise without warning, stripping flesh from bone and erasing all sense of direction. Water is scarce outside the riverlands, and survival depends on preparation, knowledge, and restraint. The Maru does not reward endurance alone. It rewards discipline.

Beneath the dunes lies the true weight of the desert. The Maru is riddled with ancient ruins, buried necropolises, collapsed temples, and forgotten cities dating back thousands of years. Wind occasionally exposes stonework, statues, or stairways that vanish again within weeks. Many of these remnants predate Esjiq itself, suggesting cycles of civilization that rose, ruled, and were unmade long before the current age.

Culturally, the desert is treated with reverence and fear. To the people of Esjiq, it is both a grave and a proving ground, a place where life and death are in constant negotiation. Expeditions venture into the sands seeking relics, lost knowledge, or divine favor, but few return unchanged. The desert remembers everything that endures, and destroys everything that does not.
