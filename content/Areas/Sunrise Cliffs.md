## Overview 

The Sunrise Cliffs rise sharply from the southwestern waters of the [[Stovlok Sea]], forming a long sweep of pale stone that catches the first light of day. Carved from chalky white rock and worn smooth by wind and salt, the cliffs glow at dawn, reflecting gold and rose hues across the water. At sunrise, the effect is striking enough to be seen from far offshore, even through lingering fog.

The cliffs are steep and imposing, broken by narrow terraces, natural alcoves, and stair-like fractures where stone has collapsed over centuries. Above them, the land rises gently, while below, deep water presses close to the rock face, making approach by sea dramatic and often hazardous outside calm conditions. The whiteness of the stone persists inland, giving the region a stark, luminous character unlike anywhere else along the Stovlok’s shores.

Local legend tells of an aasimar people who fled bondage and crossed the Stovlok Sea seeking freedom. A violent storm overtook them, lasting days and blackening the sky until hope had nearly failed. On the morning of the third day, a single beam of sunlight pierced the clouds and illuminated the cliffs ahead. Taking this as divine mercy, the refugees made landfall and gave thanks to Solara, believing she had guided them to safety.

Upon these cliffs they founded the city of [[Palindrar]], building directly into the white stone. Homes, temples, and public terraces cascade down the cliff face in layered tiers, their pale walls reflecting sunlight throughout the day. The architecture favors open courtyards, narrow winding streets, and broad sea-facing balconies, designed to welcome light and wind while sheltering inhabitants from storms.

The Sunrise Cliffs are both landmark and symbol. To sailors, they are a sign of safe harbor after long passage. To the people of Palindrar, they are a reminder of deliverance and renewal, a place where light broke through despair and reshaped destiny. Even those unmoved by faith rarely dispute the power of the sight. When the sun rises over the Stovlok and the cliffs ignite with color, the moment feels deliberate, as if the world itself chose to be seen.
