## Overview 

The Sky Razor Range is the tallest mountain chain in the known world, running along the eastern edge of northern [[Isomar]] before continuing into southern [[Al'Dira]]. Its spine cuts across nearly every latitude, shifting from frozen high-altitude deserts in the far north to storm-lashed peaks and lush green hills closer to the equator. From a distance, the range appears less like a series of mountains and more like a jagged wall driven upward from the earth itself.

The mountains are defined by extreme elevation. Many peaks rise directly from lowlands with little warning, their upper slopes vanishing into constant cloud cover. Air thins rapidly, weather changes without pattern, and sunlight often feels distant even on clear days. Snow and ice crown the highest summits year-round, while lower elevations experience violent seasonal contrasts shaped by altitude rather than latitude.

The Sky Razors form a continental boundary in every sense. They block trade, fracture cultures, and redirect rivers across thousands of miles. Only a handful of passes are known, and even these are unreliable, closing for decades at a time due to landslides, glacial advance, or seismic upheaval. Entire civilizations have developed on either side of the range with little direct contact, their myths shaped as much by the mountains as by any god.

Geologically, the range is unstable and alive. Earthquakes are common, valleys are abruptly uplifted or collapsed, and avalanches can reshape whole regions overnight. Ancient stone structures cling to cliffs where no modern road could survive, hinting that the range was once traversed more freely or by beings for whom its scale was less forbidding.

The Sky Razor Range is not merely high. It lords in its height, imposing a sense of separation between sky and ground that few other places can match. Travelers speak of vertigo not just from elevation, but from the feeling that the world below has been abandoned entirely.
