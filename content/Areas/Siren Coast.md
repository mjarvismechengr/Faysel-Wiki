## Overview 

The Siren Coast runs the length of western [[Isomar]], where land meets the restless waters of the [[Siren Sea]]. It is not a single landscape, but a continuous edge defined by sharp transitions, shifting weather, and constant movement. From north to south, the coast changes character dramatically, shaped by what presses against it from inland.

Along the northern stretches, the coastline is dominated by the shadow of the [[Endor Forest]]. Here, dark conifers and sheer cliffs meet cold surf, with narrow beaches, rocky headlands, and fogbound inlets. Settlements are sparse and often precarious, relying on sheltered coves and river mouths for access to the sea. Storms are frequent, and visibility can vanish without warning.

Further south, the coast flattens as it passes into the [[West Marsh]]. The shoreline becomes a maze of estuaries, barrier islands, tidal flats, and slow-moving channels. Ports and cities cluster where solid ground allows, supported by dredged waterways and sea walls. Trade flourishes here, but so do piracy, smuggling, and the quiet disappearance of ships that stray too far from known routes.

The Siren Coast is economically vital and strategically dangerous. Nearly all western trade into and out of Isomar passes through its ports, yet the sea itself is infamous for sudden storms, treacherous reefs, and persistent legends of voices and visions that lure vessels off course. Whether superstition or something older, sailors take these stories seriously.
