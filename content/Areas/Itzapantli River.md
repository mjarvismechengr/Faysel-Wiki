## Overview 

The Itzapantli River is the dominant waterway of the [[Jvarro Jungle]], a vast and slow-moving river system that defines the geography, ecology, and history of [[northern Aequitorra]]. Fed by countless tributaries from surrounding highlands and seasonal floodplains, it forms the central artery of the jungle, shaping the land far more reliably than any road or border.

The river is immense in scale. In many stretches its banks lie miles apart during the wet season, swallowing forests, villages, and ancient stoneworks beneath churning brown water. During drier months, sandbars emerge and channels shift, creating temporary islands and dangerous shallows that can strand or destroy unprepared vessels. Its current is steady rather than swift, but its sheer volume makes resistance futile.

The Itzapantli is the primary route of travel through the jungle. Overland movement is slow and punishing, while the river offers relative speed and a consistent direction. As a result, nearly all known settlements, ruins, and trade routes in the region either sit directly along its banks or connect to one of its major tributaries. Control of the river, even locally, confers influence far beyond the surrounding land.

Life along the Itzapantli is abundant and dangerous. The river supports immense biodiversity, from massive fish and reptiles to swarms of insects and predatory birds that follow seasonal migrations. The waters themselves are unpredictable, hiding submerged debris, shifting channels, and creatures adapted to murky depths. Flood cycles replenish the soil but erase the boundary between land and water, forcing inhabitants to build high, move often, or accept loss as inevitable.

Culturally, the river is treated less as a feature and more as a living presence. Stories of vanished cities, swallowed temples, and drifting relics are common, and few doubt their truth.

The river ultimately empties into the [[Blood Sea]], carrying with it the accumulated weight of the jungle. What enters the Itzapantli does not simply flow downstream. It is dispersed, transformed, and often lost, leaving only fragments to surface far from their point of origin.
