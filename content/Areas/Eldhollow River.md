## Overview 

The Eldhollow River is the largest and most consequential river within the [[Endor Forest]], serving as its primary east–west artery despite being only partially navigable. It rises in the wooded hills near the town of [[Mithcreek]], where trace deposits of mithral give the water a faint metallic shimmer after heavy rains. From there, the river cuts westward through dense forest and broken terrain, shaping settlement and movement far more through proximity than through travel by boat.

Early in its course, the Eldhollow joins with a major tributary to form [[Lake Eldmere]], a broad, mist-prone body of water that acts as a natural gathering point for traffic moving along the riverbanks. Beyond the lake, the river resumes its westward flow, alternating between calm stretches and violent interruptions of rapids, waterfalls, and sudden drops. These features make sustained river travel impractical, limiting navigation to short, controlled segments rather than continuous passage.

What gives the Eldhollow its true importance is not the water, but the road that follows it. The [[Eldhollow Road]] runs alongside much of the river’s length and is the only reliable east–west route cutting through the Endor Forest. Caravans, patrols, and messengers all depend on this corridor, making the riverbank a lifeline for trade, communication, and military movement in a region otherwise defined by isolation.

Roughly halfway between the river’s source and its mouth lies the city of [[Liberty]], perched on hilly terrain at a bend in the river just west of Lake Eldmere. The city grew around Chasmkeep, originally raised as a fortress during an ancient war. Today, Liberty is the capital of the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]] and one of the largest cities in the [[Kingdom of Thrane]], functioning as a frontier stronghold, trade hub, and center of scholarship. Its presence anchors the central Eldhollow and keeps the road passable under constant watch.

As the river nears the coast, it spreads and slows, flooding outward into the region known as [[Black Bog]]. The Eldhollow’s waters here become dark and unreliable, bleeding into marshland thick with decay and old magic. Near this dangerous delta lies the coastal town of [[Marshfield]], which survives through careful management of tides, trade, and whatever comes drifting downriver.

The Eldhollow ultimately empties into the [[Siren Sea]], carrying timber, ore, goods, and rumor from the forest’s interior to the wider world. More than any other feature in the Endor, the river defines where people live, where they travel, and where authority can realistically reach.
