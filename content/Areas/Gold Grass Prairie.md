## Overview 

The Gold Grass Prairie stretches east of the [[Goldwood]] in a vast expanse of open land defined by rolling hills, tall amber grasses, and an almost overwhelming sky. The land feels deliberately open after the forests to the west, with horizons measured in miles and weather visible long before it arrives. Wind is the prairie’s constant companion, rippling the grass in waves that resemble a quiet, endless sea.

The prairie’s name comes from the tall native grasses that dominate the region, turning gold in the sun for much of the year. These grasses are hardy and resilient, surviving drought, fire, and seasonal storms. Farming communities carve wide fields into the land, but large stretches remain untamed, used for grazing or left wild by choice rather than neglect.

The climate is temperate but volatile. Long, bright growing seasons are broken by sudden storms, hard rains, and powerful winds that can flatten crops or scour the land clean. Winters are cold but brief, while summers are hot and dry, rewarding preparation and punishing complacency. Unlike the forests, nothing here hides the weather. When it comes, it comes openly.

Culturally, the Gold Grass Prairie sits between frontier and hearth. Settlements tend to be spread out, centered on farms, ranches, and trade crossroads rather than dense cities. People value self-reliance, land stewardship, and practical skill, but also maintain strong communal traditions tied to harvests, shared labor, and seasonal festivals. Horses, draft animals, and wagons are common sights, and travel between homesteads is a normal part of life rather than an expedition.

The prairie carries its own dangers. Predators roam the tall grass, bandits exploit the open roads, and storms can be as lethal as any monster. With few natural landmarks, travelers can become lost more easily than expected, especially during heavy rain or blowing dust. Still, the land feels honest. Threats are visible, distances are clear, and survival depends more on preparation and judgment than secrecy or strength. It is land meant to be worked, crossed, and lived upon, offering abundance to those willing to endure its exposure.
