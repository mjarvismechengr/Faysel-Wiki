## Overview 

The Iron Hills are a low but rugged stretch of mineral-rich high ground near the center of the [[Gold Grass Prairie]] on the continent of [[Isomar]]. Rising gently from the surrounding plains, the hills break the prairie’s otherwise open horizon with exposed stone, sparse tree cover, and scarred earth where the land has been cut open for generations.

The region is named plainly and accurately. The hills are dense with iron and other valuable ores, and nearly every ridge bears the marks of excavation. Open pits, deep shaft mines, slag heaps, and abandoned tunnels dot the landscape, connected by wagon roads and narrow-gauge rail lines that funnel raw material outward to the rest of the continent. Smoke and dust hang low over active sites, visible from miles away.

Settlement in the Iron Hills is practical rather than picturesque. Mining towns cluster tightly around productive veins, built to support labor, transport, and refinement rather than comfort. Populations swell and shrink with discovery and depletion, leaving behind half-finished structures and silent machinery when a vein runs dry. Wealth is unevenly distributed, and fortunes rise and fall quickly.

Despite their modest height, the hills are hazardous. Collapses, toxic runoff, and long-abandoned workings pose constant danger, especially where oversight is thin. Banditry and claim disputes are common, and old tunnels sometimes break into far older stonework that predates recorded mining, hinting that the hills have drawn attention far longer than current maps suggest.
