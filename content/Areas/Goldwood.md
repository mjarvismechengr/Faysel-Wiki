## Overview 

The Goldwood is a broad deciduous forest lying east of the [[Endor Forest]], marked by a perpetual autumn that never deepens into winter nor retreats into spring. Its canopy burns with gold, amber, and deep red throughout the year, as if the forest exists in a single, arrested moment of seasonal change. Leaves fall, decay, and are replaced in an endless cycle that never advances. Cool winds move steadily through the trees, carrying the scent of leaf mold, ripening grain, and distant rain.

The prevailing belief among scholars and priests is that the forest was placed into temporal stasis by [[Calypso]], though no surviving doctrine explains why. The forest still grows, still feeds wildlife, and still changes in small ways, yet the larger rhythm of the seasons remains fixed. Crops planted along its edges mature reliably, and animals born within the Goldwood age normally, suggesting the effect is selective rather than absolute.

The terrain is gentler than the Endor’s deep rain-soaked wilderness. Rolling hills, clear streams, and broad groves of oak, maple, and quaking aspen define the landscape. Sunlight filters through thinning canopies rather than being smothered by them, and visibility is often measured in hundreds of feet rather than yards. Paths remain open longer here, and fallen trees are less likely to vanish beneath moss and rot.

Though still wild, the Goldwood feels watched in a different way. The forest is active rather than hostile, shaped by cycles of growth, harvest, and decay that feel intentional rather than predatory. Predators exist, but they are part of a visible balance. Many creatures that dwell here show signs of intelligence, restraint, or ancient purpose, and encounters are as likely to test judgment as they are strength.

The Goldwood is dangerous, but not oppressive. Travelers speak of a sense of being measured rather than hunted, as if the forest weighs intent before deciding how harshly to respond. Those who respect its rhythms often pass through unchallenged. Those who seek to exploit it too aggressively tend to find their journeys shortened, redirected, or quietly undone.
