## Overview 

The Thrymholt Glacier sprawls along the northern face of the [[Jotunspire Peaks]], a colossal, slow-moving mass of ice that defines the climate and geography of the high north. Fed by constant snowfall and compressed over countless ages, the glacier presses outward from the mountains like a frozen tide, grinding stone into powder and reshaping valleys with quiet inevitability.

The ice is ancient and restless. Crevasses split without warning, ice cliffs calve into frozen lakes, and entire sections of terrain vanish beneath advancing sheets of blue-white ice. What the glacier consumes is not destroyed so much as preserved, sealed away beneath layers of compacted snow and time. Ruins, battlefields, and the remains of colossal creatures are occasionally revealed where the ice retreats, only to be swallowed again years later.

Cold winds pour off the glacier year-round, keeping the northern slopes of the Jotunspires locked in snow even during warmer seasons elsewhere. Rivers born from meltwater carve sharp channels through the foothills before freezing again, creating a landscape in constant tension between motion and stillness. Travel near the glacier is perilous, not only due to the cold, but because the ground itself is unreliable, shifting as ice advances beneath thin layers of stone and soil.

The Thrymholt is closely associated with giants and other ancient beings that claim the high peaks and frozen valleys as ancestral territory. To them, the glacier is not an obstacle but a boundary, a proving ground, or a sacred presence tied to endurance and memory. Few mortals linger long in its shadow, and those who do often speak of an oppressive silence, broken only by the distant crack of ice tearing itself apart.
