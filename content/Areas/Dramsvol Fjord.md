## Overview 

Dramsvol Fjord cuts deep into the northern coast of [[Dimaheim]], a long, narrow inlet carved between the rising walls of the [[Jotunspire Peaks]]. Sheer stone cliffs plunge directly into dark, cold water, leaving little shoreline beyond scattered shelves of rock and gravel where settlements cling stubbornly to the land.

The fjord is cold year-round, fed by glacial melt and mountain runoff. Winds funnel inward from the open sea, turning storms into sudden, violent events that echo off the cliff walls. Travel by water is often safer than overland movement, as the surrounding terrain rises steeply and remains snowbound for much of the year.

Small communities dot the fjord’s length, relying on fishing, hunting, and limited trade with the outside world. Among them is the village of [[Arvidsjaur]], tucked between the fjord waters and the lower slopes of the Jotunspires. Life here is harsh and tightly bound to the seasons, with long winters, brief summers, and a culture shaped by endurance rather than comfort.

The cliffs above Dramsvol bear scars of ancient landslides, giant-forged paths, and abandoned watch points, hinting that the fjord once held greater strategic importance. Even now, the surrounding peaks are claimed by colossal beings who regard the fjord as part of their ancestral domain.
