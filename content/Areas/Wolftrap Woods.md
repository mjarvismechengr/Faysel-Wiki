## Overview 

The Wolftrap Woods is a broad taiga forest occupying the cold transitional lands between forest, prairie, and river. It lies northeast of the [[Endor Forest]] and the [[Goldwood]], north of the [[Gold Grass Prairie]], and along the southern banks of the [[Koryx River]]. The woods form a natural buffer between warmer southern regions and the harsher northern climates shaped by latitude and cold water.

The forest is dominated by dense conifers, narrow-trunked birch, and hardy undergrowth adapted to long winters and short growing seasons. Snow lingers here well into the year, and even in summer the air remains cool and damp. The canopy is thinner than in the Endor, allowing light to filter through in pale bands, but visibility is often reduced by fog rolling off the river or settling between the trees.

The Wolftrap Woods earned their name through reputation rather than exaggeration. Predators are common and bold, drawn by abundant game and long stretches of uninhabited land. Travel through the forest is slow and disorienting, with few landmarks beyond the riverbanks and the gradual rise and fall of the terrain. Sound carries poorly, and trails are easily lost beneath snow, needles, and fallen branches.

Settlements are sparse and clustered near the Koryx River, where fishing, limited trade, and seasonal movement remain viable. Away from the water, the forest is largely untamed, used primarily by hunters, trappers, and those with reason to avoid attention. Unlike the Endor, the Wolftrap does not conceal through density. It isolates through cold, distance, and silence.
