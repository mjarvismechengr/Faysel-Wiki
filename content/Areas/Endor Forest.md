## Overview 

The Endor Forest is a vast temperate rainforest stretching along the western coast of the continent of [[Isomar]], pressed between the cold waters of the [[Siren Sea]] and the rising woodlands of the [[Goldwood]]. Its canopy is dense, ancient, and perpetually damp, with towering conifers, broadleaf giants, and moss-choked understory that swallows roads within weeks.

The southern reaches of the forest fall nominally within the borders of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]], while the northern expanse is considered unclaimed territory. In practice, these distinctions mean little. Authority fades quickly beneath the trees. Patrols rarely venture far from the forest’s edge, and no power truly governs what lies beneath the canopy.

Visibility is limited, sound carries strangely, and distance is deceptive. Travel is slow even for experienced guides, with tangled roots, steep ravines, and sudden bogs breaking any sense of straight passage. The forest is alive in a way that feels watchful rather than welcoming. Wildlife is abundant and often dangerous, ranging from mundane predators to creatures shaped by ancient magic and forgotten influence.

Despite its proximity to settled lands and the sea, much of the Endor remains unexplored. Old paths vanish, ruins are swallowed whole, and landmarks shift as fallen giants reshape the terrain. What knowledge exists is fragmented, passed through rumors, partial maps, and the accounts of those few who entered deep enough to return.

The Endor is not a single wilderness but a layered one. Coastal cliffs give way to mist-heavy lowlands, which rise into ancient high forest and broken interior valleys where sunlight rarely reaches the ground. Each region feels distinct, as if the forest were many places wearing the same name.

For those who travel it, the Endor is not merely a backdrop but an active presence. It conceals, isolates, and endures. Whatever once happened beneath its boughs has been buried thoroughly, and the forest shows no interest in giving its secrets back.
