## Overview 

The Mistspires are a vast region of levitating mountains, shattered plateaus, and drifting stone masses that form the southern reaches of the continent of [[Wanakona]]. Though often described as being in the sky, the Mistspires are better understood as a broken landscape suspended in constant motion, anchored loosely by gravity, magic, and mist rather than by bedrock.

According to myth, the Mistspires were created during the making of [[Manai]], when a portion of [[Al'Dira]] was torn violently from the world. This act severed the land bridge that once connected Al’Dira to Wanakona and left the surrounding region steeped in unstable planar energy. The damage never healed. Instead, the land fractured, rose, and refused to settle, creating the floating spires seen today.

The region is saturated with planar magic. Gravity fluctuates unpredictably, distances warp, and mist rolls endlessly between drifting landmasses, obscuring depth and scale. Some spires remain relatively stable, supporting forests, ruins, and nesting grounds, while others slowly migrate, collide, or shear apart over centuries. Travel between them is perilous, relying on airships, powerful magic, or creatures native to the skies.

Wanakona as a whole is known as the birthplace of dragons, and the Mistspires are their most sacred and dangerous domain. Dragons of many kinds claim entire spires as territory, nesting among the clouds and treating the shifting geography as instinctively as mortals treat roads. Their presence shapes everything, from migration patterns to the survival of any lesser settlement foolish enough to persist.
