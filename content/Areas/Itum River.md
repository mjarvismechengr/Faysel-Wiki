## Overview 

The Itum River is the lifeline of the [[Maru Desert]], flowing westward from the high glacial sources of the [[Sky Razor Range]] across the heart of southern [[Al'Dira]] before emptying into the [[Sunset Sea]]. In a land otherwise defined by sand and sun, the Itum is a narrow, unbroken ribbon of green that makes permanent settlement possible where none should exist.

The river’s headwaters are fed by snowmelt and high-altitude runoff, giving the Itum a reliability uncommon in desert waterways. Though its volume fluctuates seasonally, it never fully dries, and its annual floods deposit rich silt along the banks. These floods shape both agriculture and architecture, forcing settlements to build high, adapt cyclically, or accept periodic loss as part of survival.

Along its course, the desert gives way to fertile floodplains, date groves, irrigated fields, and dense population centers clustered tightly to the water. Beyond a short distance from the banks, the land returns abruptly to sand. This sharp boundary defines life in the region. Everything that grows, trades, or endures here does so because of the river.

The Itum is central to the power of the [[Kingdom of Esjiq]]. Temples, necropolises, and cities rise along its length, oriented toward the river as both spiritual symbol and practical necessity. Control of irrigation, flood timing, and river traffic is inseparable from political authority, and disruptions to the Itum’s flow are treated as existential threats rather than natural disasters.

As the river approaches the coast, it broadens and slows, breaking into marshes and channels before meeting the Sunset Sea. This delta region serves as a gateway between desert and ocean, where inland goods move outward and foreign influence presses inward. While the waters here are calmer than the open sea, the convergence of trade routes makes the region heavily contested.
