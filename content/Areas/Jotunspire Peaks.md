## Overview 

The Jotunspire Peaks are a massive east–west mountain range that cleaves the heart of [[Dimaheim]]. Their sheer height and broken spines dominate the landscape for hundreds of miles, forming a natural barrier between north and south. Though alpine in structure, with steep faces and knife-edged ridgelines, their spirit is unmistakably northern. Stone, ice, and wind define the range, and the mountains feel ancient even by the standards of the world.

Deep fjords carve into the range from the surrounding seas, flooding valleys and splitting the mountains into jagged peninsulas and island-choked waterways. These fjords serve as both rare access routes and lethal traps, where storms funnel inward and cliffs rise nearly vertical from dark water. Inland, passes are few and unreliable, often choked by snow, avalanches, or territorial inhabitants.

The Jotunspires are infamous for their density of colossal beings. Giants of many kinds claim entire valleys or peaks as ancestral territory, shaping the land through conflict, construction, and sheer presence. Dragons are likewise common, nesting among the highest spires or within glacial caverns, treating the range as a proving ground rather than a boundary. Their rivalries have scarred the mountains over centuries, leaving shattered peaks and unnatural stone formations in their wake.

On the northern face of the range lies the [[Thrymholt Glacier]], a vast, slow-moving sheet of ice that feeds frozen rivers and grinds entire valleys into polished stone. The glacier advances and retreats unpredictably, consuming ruins, exposing ancient remains, and reshaping the foothills with quiet inevitability. Cold winds spilling off the ice keep the northern slopes locked in snow far longer than geography alone would suggest.

Travel through the Jotunspire Peaks is rare and dangerous. Even well-mapped routes can vanish within a season, and survival often depends on appeasing or avoiding powers that do not recognize mortal borders or authority. The mountains do not merely block passage. They challenge it, standing as a reminder that some regions of the world were never meant to be tamed, only endured or respected from a distance.
