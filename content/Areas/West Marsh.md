## Overview 

The West Marsh is a sprawling wetland region occupying the southwestern reaches of [[Isomar]], stretching along the coast of the [[Siren Sea]] and lying directly south of the [[Endor Forest]]. It is a land of slow water, broad skies, and sharp contrasts, where dense settlement and deep wilderness exist side by side within the borders of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]].

The marsh varies dramatically from north to south. In its northern reaches, the land is relatively stable and heavily developed, with raised ground, engineered canals, and managed waterways supporting dense population centers. The greatest of these is [[Independence]], Thrane’s capital and the largest city in the world. Here, the marsh has been bent to human will, drained, reinforced, and layered with stone and infrastructure. The surrounding region functions as the political, economic, and administrative heart of the kingdom, more urban than wild despite the water that permeates everything.

Further south, the marsh grows less orderly. Around [[Oldport]] and beyond, the land flattens and fragments into tangled waterways, cypress stands, and broad stretches of open wetland. Settlements thin out, becoming isolated towns, fishing villages, and river ports connected more by boat than by road. Some areas are well-traveled and carefully maintained, while others are functionally impassable, choked by vegetation, sinkholes, and shifting channels.

The climate is hot, humid, and alive. Storms roll in quickly from the Siren Sea, flooding low ground and reshaping the marsh season by season. Wildlife is abundant and often dangerous, especially in the southern reaches where monsters, ancient ruins, and half-submerged remnants of older ages lurk beneath the waterline. These regions are widely regarded as lawless not because Thrane does not claim them, but because enforcing order there is costly and unreliable.

The West Marsh is both Thrane’s greatest strength and its most persistent liability. It supports vast populations, trade, and industry, yet harbors wilderness close enough to swallow roads, towns, and expeditions without warning. Where the Endor Forest conceals and the plains expose, the West Marsh entangles, offering prosperity, danger, and decay in equal measure.
