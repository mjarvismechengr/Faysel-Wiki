## Overview 

The Roaring Brook River cuts a faster, more aggressive path through the [[Endor Forest]] before reaching the [[Siren Sea]] at [[Seabrook]]. Narrower than the [[Brannach River]] and fed by steeper terrain, it earns its name through constant rapids and sudden drops. While unsuitable for large vessels, it is vital for mills, fisheries, and fresh water along its lower reaches. During heavy rains, the river becomes dangerous even near the coast, its sound carrying far inland as a warning rather than a landmark.
