## Overview 

The Veirn River runs westward from the interior of the [[Endor Forest]] before joining the [[Koryx River]] near its mouth at the [[Siren Sea]]. Its waters are colder and deeper than those of the [[Brannach River]] or [[Roaring Brook River]], fed by shaded uplands and slow-moving forest tributaries. Despite this, the river sees almost no traffic.

The Veirn’s course leads directly into the heart of the Endor, a region with little settlement, few resources worth exporting, and no strategic incentive for regular travel. What navigable stretches exist are unused, their banks overgrown and unmaintained. Old docks and abandoned landings occasionally surface along the lower river, suggesting attempts at development that never endured.
