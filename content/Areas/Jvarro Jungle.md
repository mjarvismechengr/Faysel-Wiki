## Overview 

The Jvarro Jungle is a vast tropical rainforest dominating the northern reaches of the continent of [[Aequitorra]]. Dense, humid, and biologically overwhelming, it forms an immense green basin hemmed in by highlands and distant mountains, with countless tributaries feeding toward a single arterial river at its heart. From above, the canopy appears nearly unbroken, a living ocean of green stretching to the horizon.

The jungle is defined by excess. Rainfall is frequent and intense, heat is constant, and growth is relentless. Vines overtake stone within months, fallen trees become soil in years, and clearings vanish almost as soon as they are made. Visibility is short, sound is distorted, and movement through the interior is slow even for those accustomed to jungle travel. The forest does not feel hostile so much as indifferent, continuing its cycles regardless of who passes through.

At the center of the Jvarro lies the [[Itzapantli River]], a massive waterway fed by hundreds of tributaries and seasonal floods. Its slow curves and shifting banks shape the jungle’s ecology, creating fertile floodplains, drowned forests, and labyrinthine wetlands. The river ultimately empties into the Blood Sea, carrying silt, seeds, and secrets from deep within the continent.

Life in the Jvarro is dense and layered. The forest canopy teems with birds, insects, and climbing predators, while the understory hides amphibians, serpents, and ancient things that rarely see the sun. Many species here exist nowhere else in the world, such as dinosaurs, adapted to constant competition and abundance. Predators are bold, prey is scarce despite appearances, and nearly everything either hunts, hides, or poisons.

Though sparsely settled by outsiders, the jungle is far from empty. Countless ruins, overgrown causeways, and drowned stoneworks suggest civilizations that once thrived along its rivers and plateaus before being reclaimed by the forest. Whether these cultures fell to war, disease, or something older is unclear, as the jungle preserves little beyond fragments and myths.

The Jvarro Jungle is not easily conquered or cataloged. Expeditions vanish, maps contradict one another, and landmarks shift with the seasons. For those who enter, the jungle does not test morality or intent. It tests endurance, awareness, and respect for a land that neither knows nor cares who rules beyond its borders.
