## Overview 

The Padrich Woods lie along the western foothills of the [[Sky Razor Range]] in eastern [[Isomar]], where the mountains descend into dense, shadowed forest. Old-growth trees crowd close together here, their canopies blotting out much of the light even at midday. Fog clings low to the ground, and the air is heavy with damp earth, rot, and woodsmoke.

The woods are steeped in a reputation for darkness that is largely earned. Vampires, werewolves, and other nocturnal predators are not rumors but fixtures of the region, woven into local life as unavoidable facts rather than distant legends. Villages are fortified, windows are shuttered at dusk, and traditions surrounding warding, burial, and bloodlines are followed with grim seriousness. Survival here depends as much on ritual and caution as on steel.

Culturally, the Padrich Woods are insular and deeply superstitious. Communities are small, tightly bound, and slow to trust outsiders. Stone chapels, graveyards, and half-ruined keeps rise from clearings and hilltops, remnants of past attempts to impose order on a land that resists it. Stories are passed down orally, often contradicting one another, but all agree on one truth: the forest listens.

To the north, the woods give way to a creeping wall of unnatural mist that marks the threshold of an unseen boundary. This boundary is feared and avoided, treated not as a border but as a wound in the world. The presence of the mist seeps southward at times, thickening fogs and warping sound and distance within the forest, reinforcing the sense that the Padrich exists in the shadow of something far worse than itself.
