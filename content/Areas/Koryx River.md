## Overview 

The Koryx River is one of the largest and most economically vital rivers in the world, flowing east to west across the northern latitudes of [[Isomar]] before emptying into the Siren Sea. Its headwaters originate in the [[Stovlok Sea]], where centuries of glacial runoff and mountain-fed rivers spill outward into a single, powerful outflow. From there, the Koryx cuts a long, cold path toward the western coast.

For much of its length, the river marks a natural divide. As it nears the [[Siren Sea]], the Koryx forms a political and cultural boundary between northern [[Isomar]] and southern [[Dimaheim]]. This division has made the river both a meeting point and a fault line, shaping trade agreements, border disputes, and military strategy for generations.

The Koryx is broadly navigable, its width and depth allowing large vessels to travel great distances inland. However, this accessibility is broken by stretches of violent rapids and massive waterfalls, where the river drops sharply through ancient stone. In several regions, the river is confined within deep gorges, its waters funneling through narrow channels that amplify current and cold. These sections are impassable by ship and must be bypassed by overland routes or portage towns that exist solely to serve this function.

The climate along the Koryx is harsh. Its northern latitude keeps the water frigid year-round, fed continuously by snowmelt and glacial sources. Fog is common, especially near dawn and dusk, and ice forms along the banks in winter months without fully sealing the river. Travel remains possible, but never comfortable, and mistakes are punished quickly.

Despite its dangers, the Koryx is indispensable. It forms the primary trade artery between the inland economies surrounding the Stovlok Sea and the coastal powers of the Siren Sea. Grain, timber, metals, and finished goods move along its length, supported by a chain of fortified ports, river towns, and customs stations. Control of these nodes is often more valuable than control of the surrounding land.
