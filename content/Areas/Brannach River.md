## Overview 

The Brannach River flows out of the western hills of the Endor Forest and empties into the [[Siren Sea]] near the town of [[Winskey]]. It is a steady, but not navigable for much of its length, bordered by old forest and low bluffs rather than deep gorges. The Brannach serves as a small local trade route, moving small amounts of timber, game, and inland goods toward the coast. Flooding is rare, but seasonal rains can swell it enough to reshape its banks, occasionally uncovering old camps or forgotten paths along its edges.
