## Overview 

The Ixchitl Cordillera is a long, rugged mountain range running roughly north to south along the western edge of the [[Jvarro Jungle]] on the continent of [[Aequitorra]]. Steep, broken, and perpetually cloaked in cloud, the range forms a natural wall between the jungle basin and the western reaches of the continent.

The cordillera is highly volcanic. Active and dormant peaks dot its length, venting ash, steam, and sulfur into the air. Eruptions are infrequent but devastating, triggering landslides, lahars, and sudden changes to river courses. Volcanic soil enriches the lower slopes, feeding dense vegetation and contributing to the extraordinary fertility of the jungle basin below.

Moist air rolling in from the west is forced upward by the mountains, sustaining constant rainfall on the eastern slopes while leaving the far side comparatively drier. Earthquakes are common, and passes are unstable, often erased by erosion, collapse, or fresh lava flows. Travel through the range is slow and dangerous, with routes that change from decade to decade.

The Ixchitl Cordillera has played a major role in isolating the Jvarro from large-scale settlement and conquest. While sparsely populated, the range is not empty. Isolated communities, ancient ruins, and creatures adapted to ash, altitude, and heat cling to its slopes. Many of the jungle’s great rivers trace their earliest origins to meltwater, rainfall, and volcanic runoff from these peaks.
