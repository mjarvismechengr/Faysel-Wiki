## Overview 

The Trollskog Forest blankets the southwestern peninsula of [[Dimaheim]], stretching from the lower slopes of the [[Jotunspire Peaks]] to the storm-lashed shores of the [[Siren Sea]]. It is a vast, old-growth woodland of dark pine, twisted birch, and moss-draped stone, where the canopy thickens toward the interior and the ground remains damp even in the height of summer. The forest marks a gradual descent from mountain to coast, its terrain shifting from rocky uplands in the east to dense lowland timber and wind-bent coastal growth in the west.

Trollskog takes its name not from rumor but from reality. Trolls dwell in its ravines and beneath its root-choked clearings, emerging at dusk or during long winter nights to hunt, steal, or simply remind travelers that the forest does not belong to them. Giants are known to move along the outer ridgelines, and great wolves and cave bears claim broad swaths of territory without regard for tribal boundaries. The creatures of Trollskog are not rare intrusions but part of the forest’s natural order. Survival here demands vigilance, cooperation, and an acceptance that the wild will never be fully subdued.

Despite its dangers, Trollskog is not uninhabited. Three principal settlements endure within its bounds. [[Arvidsjaur]] lies along the eastern edge near the fjords and the foothills of the mountains. Deeper into the peninsula’s interior stands [[Vargheim]], positioned amid thick forest routes that connect coast and highland. At the southwestern tip rests [[Bjornhavn]], where the trees thin and the sea dominates the horizon. These communities are separated by long stretches of forest road and hunting trail, yet they remain bound by trade, kinship, and shared necessity.

Travel through Trollskog is deliberate and often slow. Roads are narrow and prone to flooding or collapse beneath encroaching roots. Sound carries unevenly, muffled by moss or echoed strangely between trunks. In winter, snow weighs heavy on branches and turns familiar paths into white corridors of disorientation. In summer, mist rolls inland from the sea and lingers between the trees well past dawn.

Within the greater landscape of Dimaheim, Trollskog represents both barrier and refuge. It shields the peninsula from easy invasion, yet it also isolates its settlements from swift aid. It provides timber, game, and concealment, but it also demands payment in caution and blood. Those who live within it learn early that the trees are older than any tribe and will remain long after the last hall has fallen silent.
