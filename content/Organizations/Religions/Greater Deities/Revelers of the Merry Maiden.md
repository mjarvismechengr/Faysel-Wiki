## Overview

The Revelers of the Merry Maiden are the primary faith devoted to [[Thalia]], though many who take part would hesitate to call themselves members of a church at all. The Revelers are less an institution and more a living current that moves through taverns, theaters, festivals, studios, and street corners wherever people gather to make music, tell stories, flirt, gamble, dance, and laugh. In practice, the faith is both enormous and diffuse. Almost everyone has brushed against it, but fewer commit themselves to it with the seriousness reserved for gods of law, war, or death.

Its heart is in [[Solbrun]], a city known for art, performance, and social heat, where the Revelers maintain their largest halls and most recognizable circles of clergy. Even there, structure remains loose by design. The Revelers thrive on local flavor, improvisation, and the belief that joy cannot be standardized without being diminished. Most chapters operate independently, bound together by shared customs, traveling performers, and the quiet recognition that a good party can be as sacred as a solemn rite.

Because Thalia’s worship is expressed through public celebration, the faith is generally tolerated, welcomed, and sometimes quietly encouraged by civic leaders who understand what morale can do for a strained community. Tension arises when devotion becomes disruptive, when pranks turn cruel, when passion becomes predation, or when local authorities attempt to control art and revelry through censorship. In those moments, the Revelers are at their most defiant, treating joy as something worth protecting.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Revelers teach that life is brief and that meaning is made, not granted. Joy is not treated as an escape from suffering, but as a refusal to let suffering win. Song, art, seduction, comedy, and shared celebration are understood as acts of survival and connection. To create is to declare that the world is still worth inhabiting. To laugh is to steal power back from despair. To tell the story is to ensure that pain does not get the final word.

Luck is central to Thalia’s worship, not as prophecy or fate, but as chance embraced. The Revelers honor risk, impulse, and the willingness to step into uncertainty for the sake of experience. They admire bold choices, honest emotion, and the kind of foolish courage that produces either a triumph worth singing about or a failure worth retelling forever.

> - **Live in Rhythmic Harmony:** Find your muse and create with passion, for in art, you share a piece of your soul.

> - **Roll the Dice:** Take chances, even if the odds don't favor you. There will be great joy in your unlikely success, and great tales to be told of your failure.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Thalia’s clergy are most often artists and organizers rather than solemn priests. They serve as performers, playwrights, dancers, musicians, tavern hosts, matchmakers, patrons, festival coordinators, and curators of local culture. Many travel, carrying stories and songs between cities and villages, stitching communities together through shared refrains and familiar rituals. Others keep permanent halls where anyone can eat, drink, perform, or confess without being judged for wanting to feel alive.

Worshippers range from devoted celebrants to casual participants. Some people keep Thalia close as a private comfort, offering a toast to her before a risky decision or a kiss before a long journey. Others treat her as the patron of their craft or their appetite for experience, returning to her circles for inspiration, companionship, and permission to be unapologetically human. The faith is especially common among bards, artisans, gamblers, lovers, and those who have survived hardship and refuse to live as if they have not.

### Symbols

The symbol most associated with the Revelers is a golden goblet overflowing with wine, with a quill rising from it. It appears painted on stage doors, carved into bar tops, stitched into costumes, or hidden in murals where only the observant will notice. In some places the goblet is replaced with a tankard, a teacup, or a glass shaped to local taste, but the meaning remains the same. indulgence and inspiration poured from the same vessel.

Overt regalia is uncommon. Many devotees prefer symbols that can pass as decoration, both because Thalia’s worship thrives in mixed crowds and because subtlety is part of the fun. A performer might wear a small goblet charm. A writer might mark a page corner with the quill and cup. A tavern might display the emblem in plain sight as if it were only a flourish of design. Among more devoted circles, the symbol is sometimes incorporated into pranks and hidden tributes, tucked into the architecture of other temples or slipped into formal events as a quiet reminder that joy can exist even where it is not officially welcomed.
