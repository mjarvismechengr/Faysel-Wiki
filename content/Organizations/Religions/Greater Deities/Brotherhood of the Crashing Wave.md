## Overview

The Brotherhood of the Crashing Wave is the primary faith devoted to [[Iskandar]], practiced wherever people live close to sky, sea, and the knowledge that certainty is a luxury. It is common to find shrines in ports, lighthouses, cliffside paths, and high passes where storms gather, but true devotion is rarer than visibility suggests. Many offer quick prayers to the Tempest King before a voyage or during a violent squall, yet few choose to live by his full doctrine. To most of the public, Iskandar is respected as a force that must be acknowledged, not a god meant to be adored.

The brotherhood’s influence spreads through necessity rather than politics. Storms decide trade, fishing, travel, and survival. Stormseers are therefore tolerated and often welcomed, even by those who find them unsettling, because they provide counsel when maps fail and people go missing. They bless ships and crews, keep records of wrecks and lost routes, and serve as guides for those searching for someone who never returned. Their rites are not built around comfort. They are built around the acceptance that the world has depths that do not explain themselves.

In many regions the brotherhood is loosely organized. A lighthouse chapter may have little in common with a mountaintop shrine beyond shared prayers and shared symbols. Some chapters are gentle and practical, acting as wardens and rescuers. Others are wild, celebratory, and openly given to Iskandar’s mood, hosting storm feasts and reckless vows that locals remember for years. Across all of them runs the same core belief: being lost is not shameful, and mystery is not an enemy. It is part of the world’s honest shape.

## Culture

### Dogma

The Brotherhood of the Crashing Wave teaches that the world cannot be fully controlled or fully known, and that pretending otherwise invites ruin. Storms, seas, and the hidden corners of life are not punishments to be explained away. They are reminders that existence is larger than any plan. Followers are called to meet the unknown without cowardice, to respect fury without worshipping mindless destruction, and to keep faith with the lost, whether the lost are people, truths, or entire histories swallowed by time. Iskandar does not promise safety. He promises that what is forgotten still matters, and that steadfastness is a kind of victory.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Respect Nature's Fury:** Recognize the might and unpredictability of the elements and treat them with reverence. Treat storms and seas as honest forces. Prepare for them, honor them, and do not pretend you can bargain with them.
> 
> - **Embrace Fury:** Find strength in the tempestuous nature of the sky and sea. Let emotion flow through you like a storm. Do not bottle it into poison. When storms of life approach, meet them with tenacity, and let the fury of the tempest empower your spirit. 
> 
> - **Honor the Lost:** Remember names, tell stories, and mark the places where people vanished. The lost are not erased simply because the world moved on.
> 
> - **Seek the Forgotten:** Explore the unknown, recover what's lost, and appreciate the mysteries of the world.  Explore the mysteries and treasures hidden beneath the waves, both in the deep sea and in the hearts of forgotten tales.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Iskandar’s clergy are known as Stormseers. They are part priest, part navigator, part witness. Many serve in ports as blessers of hulls and breakers of bad omens, but their deeper role is guidance when certainty collapses. A Stormseer might join a search for missing sailors, lead a procession for those taken by the sea, or sit with a grieving family and tell the true story without softening it. In mountain regions they serve as wardens of dangerous passes and readers of storm signs. In coastal regions they often keep the ledgers of wrecks, tides, and disappearances, treating remembrance as sacred work.

Worshippers are sailors, fishers, lighthouse keepers, dockhands, explorers, climbers, and the kind of wanderers who do not always know what they are seeking. Many do not call themselves devout, yet they leave offerings all the same: a coin thrown into deep water, a cup poured out before a voyage, a knot tied and cut when a search ends, whether in rescue or loss. Those who become true adherents tend to be people who have been lost before, in body or in spirit, and found their way back changed.

### Symbols

The brotherhood’s symbol is a crashing wave split by a lightning strike. It is carved into pier posts, inked onto sailcloth, etched into the stone above lighthouse doors, and painted on cliffside markers where storms have claimed lives. In most places it is not displayed as decoration, but as a warning, a prayer, and a claim of presence all at once.

Stormseers often wear their symbols practically. Some keep a lightning shaped pin on a cloak clasp, a wave charm on a cord, or a small disk of stamped bronze that can be gripped during high seas. On ships, captains who respect Iskandar may set the symbol into the prow or hide it beneath the helm as a private appeal for endurance. On mountain roads it is sometimes cut into cairns or boundary stones, marking places where travelers vanished and where the living should stop, listen, and remember.

Color and regalia vary by chapter, but sea blues, sea greens, and storm grays are common, often worn as rough sashes or weatherproof cloaks rather than formal vestments. The most recognizable sign of a Stormseer is less what they wear and more what they carry: a storm staff topped with a metal wave, a coil of rope knotted with names of the lost, or a lantern designed to burn through heavy rain. In the Brotherhood of the Crashing Wave, symbols are meant to survive wind, salt, and grief, and to be useful when the world turns violent.
