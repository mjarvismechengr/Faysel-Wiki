## Overview

The Hearthforged Communion is the primary faith devoted to [[Cyra]], practiced wherever communities value family, craft, and the quiet work of making life worth living. It is most visible in places where creation is constant and communal: mining towns, trade cities, farming villages, and especially dwarven holds. Its institutional heart is in [[Titan]], where the communion’s traditions are closely tied to smithing culture and the belief that the forge is both a holy site and a civic necessity.

Unlike churches built around hierarchy and doctrine alone, the Hearthforged Communion is structured through households, guild ties, and local halls that function as temple, workshop, and gathering space all at once. It is broadly respected, even by those who do not consider themselves devout, because its work is tangible. It blesses births and unions, tends the sick, mediates family disputes, and supports the crafts that keep settlements alive. In many regions, the communion’s clergy are as likely to be found at a hearth or an anvil as at an altar.

Politically, the communion is stabilizing and generally nonpartisan. It rarely challenges rulers directly, but it often exerts influence through its role in civic life. A town that depends on its smiths, midwives, and healers cannot afford to alienate them. The communion’s leaders tend to negotiate rather than threaten, pressing for policies that protect families, secure supply lines, and preserve the dignity of labor. In places where power is abused, the communion’s resistance is usually quiet and collective: mutual aid, withheld craftsmanship, and the slow building of alternative support networks.

## Culture

### Dogma

The Hearthforged Communion teaches that life is sacred because it can be made, shaped, and protected. Family, in blood and in chosen bonds, is the forge in which the soul is tempered. Creation is treated as a holy act, whether it is the crafting of a tool, the building of a home, the raising of a child, or the healing of a wounded body. Followers are encouraged to create with intention, to endure the heat of hardship without becoming brittle, and to measure their worth by what they build and preserve rather than what they take.

### Clergy & Worshippers

The communion’s clergy are often counselors, healers, midwives, and craftspeople first, and priests second. Many serve openly as blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, brewers, and textile workers, embedding religious practice into daily labor rather than separating it into a distant priesthood. In smaller settlements, a single priest might also serve as the town’s medic, marriage officiant, and recordkeeper of lineages.

Worshippers range widely. Families seek Cyra’s blessing in moments of beginning and commitment, artisans invoke her before difficult work, and communities turn to the communion during disaster when food, shelter, and coordinated rebuilding matter more than sermons. Offerings are often handmade: a well made tool, a quilt, a carved charm, a loaf baked for the needy.

### Symbols

The communion’s symbol is a forging hammer rendered in rainbow hues, commonly displayed outside forges, workshops, and communal halls. When flown as a banner, it is often a white hammer on a rainbow field, signaling sanctuary, aid, and the presence of Cyra’s clergy.

Devotees rarely wear a strict uniform, but many keep a small token of the hammer: a pendant, a stamped coin, a mark on a tool handle. More important than outward regalia are acts of dedication. A finished craft offered to a neighbor in need, a new hearth lit for a displaced family, or a shared meal after hardship are all treated as sacred expressions of the faith. In the Hearthforged Communion, symbolism is not primarily worn. It is practiced.
