## Overview

The worship of [[Calypso]] is widespread due to the fact that she is both the goddess of agriculture and seasons. This means that beyond a few haughty wizards studying the influence of chronal magic, she is worshipped all around the planet by regular folk hoping to grow enough food to survive, and hoping that the seasonal conditions favor that growth. 

The Covenant of the Turning Wheel is the primary faith devoted to [[Calypso]], practiced wherever communities live by the seasons, depend on the soil, and measure life in planting and harvest. Unlike many churches whose influence concentrates in cities or courts, Calypso’s worship is embedded in ordinary survival. Farmers, herders, millers, brewers, and local stewards look to her for reliable cycles and the patience to endure lean years.

The covenant’s public face is practical and familiar. Shrines stand at field edges and crossroads, blessings are spoken over seed and soil, and seasonal rites mark the turning points of the year. Its institutional center is in [[Y'varius]], but the covenant is not rigidly centralized. Local circles of clergy hold real authority in their own regions, adapting practice to climate, soil, and tradition while retaining a common philosophy of balance and inevitability.

Politically, the covenant tends toward stability and continuity. It rarely seeks rule, but it often becomes influential through necessity, especially in agrarian regions where food and water are matters of governance as much as labor. Its clergy keep records of harvests, weather patterns, and local precedent, making them valued advisors to villages and cities alike. In times of famine, plague, or displacement, the covenant’s response is typically measured, focused on endurance and long recovery rather than quick miracles.

## Culture

### Dogma

The Covenant of the Turning Wheel teaches that time is not a straight road but a cycle, expressed through seasons, growth and decay, and the rise and fall of all things. Change is not treated as tragedy or triumph, but as the structure of life itself. Followers are taught to respect natural rhythms, to steward the land without exhausting it, and to accept that fate and choice are intertwined. A person may shape their path, but never outside the turning of the wheel.

><u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Respect the Cycle:** Honor each season, understanding its unique role in the grand tapestry of time, and the inevitability of change.
> 
> - **Harvest of Life:** Treat the land and waters with care, for they provides sustenance and are the foundation upon which all life depends.
> 
> - **Endure the Turning:** Meet hardship with patience and preparation rather than panic, trusting that recovery is possible but never immediate.
> 
> - **Weave Your Destiny:** Make choices with humility, recognizing that fate is a current that can be navigated but not escaped.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Calypso’s clergy are known as Timekeepers. They most often serve as stewards rather than preachers, maintaining groves, tending farmland, recording local history, and preserving practical knowledge about weather, soil, and seasonal patterns. Many act as mediators in land disputes and inheritance conflicts, valued for their long memory and their reputation for restraint.

Worshippers are the working backbone of most regions. Agrarian families, rural villages, and trade networks tied to grain and livestock make up the covenant’s broad base. Devotion is usually expressed through routine acts, seasonal offerings, and communal rites. In cities, the covenant’s presence often concentrates around granaries, markets, archives, and horticultural wards.

### Symbols

The covenant’s symbol is an hourglass with falling sand colored to represent the four seasons. It appears carved into tools, etched into boundary stones, and painted onto signposts near farms and crossroads. Worshippers rarely wear overt regalia, but Timekeepers may adopt earthen and harvest hued robes during rites, practical garments designed for work as much as ceremony.
