## Overview

The Order of the Threefold Sun is the primary faith devoted to [[Solara]], and it is among the most widespread institutions in [[Faysel]]. From rural villages to major capitals, her shrines stand where light touches stone and hearth. The Order’s appeal lies partly in its flexibility. Because Solara is understood through three aspects of the sun, communities are able to emphasize the form of devotion that best reflects their needs while remaining within a shared theological framework.

Its institutional heart is in [[Matroh]], where the faith’s most prominent temples and councils reside. Local chapters retain significant autonomy, often aligning themselves more closely with one of Solara’s aspects while still affirming the unity of all three. In some regions the Wakening Sun dominates, fostering disciplined civic structure. In others the Burning Sun inspires reform, resistance, or even revolution. Where the Verdant Sun is foremost, the Order becomes a pillar of communal renewal and agricultural stability.

The Order is generally regarded as a force for good, associated with charity, courage, and visible resistance to injustice. At times, however, zeal from Burning Sun sects has tipped into excess, leading to accusations of overreach or moral absolutism. Even so, the broader faith remains deeply embedded in daily life, its fires lit at dawn, its blessings invoked at harvest, and its light called upon in moments of crisis.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Order teaches that Solara is not a single expression of flame, but a harmony of three solar truths. Light reveals. Fire transforms. Warmth sustains. Followers are encouraged to live visibly and intentionally, aligning their actions with one or more of Solara’s aspects while never denying the others. Discipline without passion becomes cold routine. Passion without renewal becomes destruction. Renewal without structure falters. It is through balance that life thrives.

Devotion is not meant to be passive. The faithful are called to act, to confront darkness openly, to rebuild what has been broken, and to kindle courage in themselves and others. Solara’s light is both comfort and challenge. To stand in it is to be seen clearly, flaws and strengths alike.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Wakening Sun:** Cherish the dawn, both physical and philosophical. The sun rises each day, dispelling darkness, bringing warmth and light. Uphold order and find purpose in life's structures. Acknowledge the sun's role in bringing light and energy to the world. Be a beacon of light in the lives of others, offering guidance and hope.
> 
> - **Burning Sun:** Understand the duality of fire. It is as much a source of warmth and light as it is a consuming force of destruction. Fire is the essence of change, both for benefit and detriment; embrace the unpredictability of life's changes.  Embrace both the fierce heat of anger and the warmth of love. Let emotions flow like the sun at its peak. Seek to express your true self and encourage others to do the same, for diversity and individuality are the sparks of life.
> 
> - **Verdant Sun:** Acknowledge the sun's life-giving power and the transformative essence of fire. Nurture growth in all aspects of life, and celebrate the bountiful cycles of nature. Celebrate the cycle of creation, destruction, and rebirth that is inherent in the elements it governs. Recognize that destruction can bring new life. This renewing spirit of change extends beyond the physical. It is this essence that enables people to be reborn; to forge new, better lives from the ashes of the old one. 
> 
> - **Unity of the Sun:** Recognize the unity of all three aspects within Solara, for it is through their harmony that the world thrives.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Clergy within the Order often dedicate themselves primarily to one aspect of Solara while affirming the unity of all three. Those aligned with the Wakening Sun commonly serve as civic leaders, teachers, and organizers, greeting each dawn with ritual prayer and encouraging disciplined living. Burning Sun clergy are frequently warriors, reformers, and outspoken advocates who confront corruption and oppression directly. Those devoted to the Verdant Sun tend to communities, oversee rebuilding efforts, and guide rites of renewal after disaster or loss.

Vestments reflect warm hues of gold, amber, red, and green-gold depending on aspect, though no single uniform binds the entire Order. Sacred fires are maintained in many temples and shrines, and sunrise observances are among the most common shared practices across sects.

Worshippers are drawn from every walk of life. Farmers offer thanks for light and warmth. Artisans and performers invoke the fire of inspiration. Soldiers pray for courage. Community leaders seek guidance in rebuilding after tragedy. The Order’s reach is broad because its theology speaks to both daily routine and moments of profound change.

### Symbols 

The central symbol of the Order is a golden sun disk with flaming rays radiating outward. It is commonly displayed on red or orange cloth, etched into temple stone, or incorporated into civic architecture in cities where Solara’s influence is strong.

Within the Order, subtle variations of the sun disk reflect emphasis on different aspects. Dawn colored accents and structured motifs often signify the Wakening Sun. Sharper, flame heavy imagery is associated with the Burning Sun. Green-gold or leaf worked designs commonly mark the Verdant Sun.

Temples are designed to capture and reflect natural light throughout the day, and ever lit braziers serve as visible reminders of Solara’s presence. While regalia varies by region, the consistent thread is radiance. The faithful do not hide their symbol. It is meant to be seen.
