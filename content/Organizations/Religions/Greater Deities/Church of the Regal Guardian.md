## Overview

The Church of the Regal Guardian is one of the most politically influential faiths on [[Faysel]]. Because [[Cyrus]] embodies law, justice, order, peace, oaths, and leadership, the church is deeply integrated into courts, councils, and systems of governance. In many nations it trains magistrates, advises rulers, witnesses contracts, and provides moral legitimacy to legal codes that claim fairness and restraint.

The church functions both as a religious body and as a civic institution. Its temples often include halls for arbitration and recordkeeping alongside sanctuaries for worship. Clergy may preside over trials, mediate disputes between nobles, formalize treaties, or certify oaths of office. Where law is respected, the presence of the church is often seen as stabilizing and reassuring.

That same proximity to power, however, creates tension. Because the church frequently operates alongside rulers and officials, it can be perceived as an extension of the state. In most regions this alignment promotes consistency and public trust. In others, especially where governance becomes rigid or heavy handed, the church’s enforcement of doctrine can appear uncompromising. The faithful believe peace must be defended through justice, but critics sometimes question who decides what justice requires.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Church teaches that peace is not passive but constructed. It arises from clear law, impartial judgment, and leaders who understand authority as a duty rather than a privilege. Justice must be measured and deliberate. Oaths must bind the one who swears them. Law must protect the innocent and restrain those who would exploit others. When order fails, suffering follows, so maintaining it is considered a moral obligation.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **The Orderly Path:** Order and structure provide the foundation upon which societies flourish and individuals find purpose.
> 
> - **Immutable Justice:** Apply the law fairly and without favoritism. Let it shield the innocent and hold the guilty accountable.
> 
> - **Honor in Action:** Conduct yourself with honor and integrity, especially when no one is watching and consequences are inconvenient.
> 
> - **Lead with Honor:** Leadership is a sacred responsibility. Lead with integrity, humility, and a commitment to the well-being of those you lead.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Clergy within the church commonly serve as judges, advocates, advisors, diplomats, and military chaplains. Many are formally trained in rhetoric, philosophy, and civic law in addition to theology. In some regions they assist in drafting legal codes or revising outdated statutes. In others they act as independent arbiters when local systems falter.

Worshippers are often found in positions of responsibility. Guards, soldiers, magistrates, and civil servants frequently look to Cyrus as an example of disciplined leadership. Services emphasize reflection on personal responsibility, reaffirmation of oaths, and the steady pursuit of fairness. Confession centers on restitution and accountability rather than emotional absolution.

### Symbols

The Church of the Regal Guardian is identified by a set of golden scales balanced on the tip of a sword. The image represents justice held steady by the readiness to enforce it. In formal display, the emblem is most often shown in gold upon a white field, colors that have become culturally associated with civic authority and lawful governance across much of [[Faysel]].

Because worship of [[Cyrus]] is widespread and socially accepted, his symbol appears openly in public life. It is carved above courthouse doors, set into mosaic floors of council chambers, embroidered into the robes of magistrates, and stamped into official documents. Even those who are not devout frequently invoke the imagery in legal and ceremonial settings as a sign of legitimacy.

Clergy and officials do not share a single mandated uniform, but white and gold garments are common during formal proceedings. Ceremonial swords are often present during oaths of office, marriage rites, and military commissions, reinforcing the connection between promise and consequence. Scales may be incorporated into jewelry, signet rings, or seals used to authenticate rulings and decrees.
