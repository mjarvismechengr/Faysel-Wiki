## Overview

The Marigold Imperium is the primary faith devoted to [[Ukaleq]], practiced wherever death is treated as a solemn passage rather than a horror to be denied. The imperium is widely respected, if rarely welcomed. Most people do not seek it out until they must, but nearly every community relies on it in some form, whether through trained funerary guides, protected burial grounds, or the rites that ensure the dead pass onward without being bound, disturbed, or exploited.

Its institutional heart is in [[Matroh]], where the imperium maintains its largest mortuaries, courts of doctrine, and schools of funerary practice. From there, its clergy move outward in a web of local shrines, cemetery chapels, and traveling Doomguides who answer requests for rites, investigation, and protection. The imperium is structured and rule bound, but not cruel. It values procedure because procedure prevents abuse. In the imperium’s view, the dead deserve clarity, and the living deserve a way to grieve without fear that the grave is a door left ajar.

Politically, the Marigold Imperium is steady and difficult to ignore. It rarely seeks power, but it is often granted influence because it holds records of lineage, inheritance, burial claims, and unresolved deaths. In places with strong courts, the imperium is consulted as an authority on final testimony, lawful burial, and the handling of remains. In places with weak rule, it becomes a stabilizing institution by necessity, providing order where panic might otherwise take hold. Its fiercest conflicts are reserved for necromancers, soul binders, and any force that turns the boundary between life and death into a resource.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Marigold Imperium teaches that death is not a moral verdict but a universal transition. Life matters because it ends, and endings must be honored so that meaning is not stolen from those who lived it. Ukaleq is revered as a guide and an arbiter, not because he condemns, but because he ensures passage. To the imperium, the greatest cruelty is not death, but interference with what follows. Souls are not to be trapped, bargained, consumed, or tethered to decaying flesh for the convenience of the living.

Rites are central because they are both comfort and safeguard. A proper passage is believed to steady the departing soul and to close the world behind it, leaving no opening for predation, haunting, or corruption. The imperium does not preach despair. It teaches composure, preparation, and respect. Grief is permitted, even honored, but panic is discouraged. Death will come. The question is whether it will be met with dignity.

> - **Embrace Death:** Accept that death is a natural part of the eternal cycle, where life and death are intertwined. Acknowledge the inevitability of one's death and passage to the afterlife and not is to be feared.
> 
> - **Guide to the Beyond:** Aid restless spirits and souls of the departed in finding their path to the afterlife, ensuring their peace and comfort on their journey. Every being will one day make this journey. Honor this transition and interfere not without purpose. Protect and guide the souls of the departed to the afterlife, ensuring they face fair judgment.
> 
> - **Judgment of the Soul:** Live virtuously and honor the departed, for in the afterlife, all souls will be weighed by their deeds and intentions. Celebrate the lives of those who have passed, remembering them with reverence and respect.
> 
> - **Guardian of the Departed:** Protect the resting places of the deceased, ensuring their passage to the afterlife is uninterrupted. Destroy abominations of undeath.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Ukaleq’s clergy are known as Doomguides. They serve as funerary priests, morticians, recordkeepers, and wardens of burial grounds, trained to perform the rites of passage with precision. Many are also mediators, called upon to settle disputes over inheritance, burial rights, and the handling of remains. In regions troubled by necromancy or unrest, Doomguides take on a sterner role as hunters and exorcists, pursuing rumors of undeath and ensuring that what should be still remains still.

Worshippers include the elderly, the infirm, those who work closely with death, and those who have been forced to become familiar with it. Veterans, judges, physicians, undertakers, and grieving families often keep Ukaleq near, not out of fascination, but out of respect and fear of what happens when death is mishandled. Devotion is typically quiet. A prayer at a graveside, a marigold placed on a threshold, a candle lit for an unclaimed dead. For many, the imperium is less a weekly practice and more a covenant made when the inevitable arrives.

### Symbols 

The imperium’s symbol is a black skull decorated with gold laid over a marigold flower. It is most often displayed on black cloth edged in gold, on carved grave markers, and on the tools used in rites: censers, bowls, bells, and funeral veils. Marigolds carry a dual meaning within the faith. They are a sign of mourning, but also a sign of guidance, a bright thread through darkness that marks the way forward.

Doomguides tend to wear formal vestments when performing rites, favoring black, marigold, and gold, with skull motifs rendered in restrained, dignified forms rather than grotesque ones. In daily life, most dress plainly, keeping their symbols as small tokens: a marigold pin, a black cord with a gold bead, a stamped seal used to mark rite completion. The imperium values signs that communicate purpose without spectacle. Its symbols are not meant to frighten the living, but to remind them that the dead are under guard.
