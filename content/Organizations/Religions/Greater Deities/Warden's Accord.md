## Overview

The Warden’s Accord is one of the most visible and socially tolerated faiths devoted to a god with openly ruthless domains, largely because it speaks the language of everyday desire. It promises that power is not a sin, that hunger is honest, and that wealth is proof of worth. In practice, many people who would never call themselves devout still participate in its customs, especially merchants, nobles, and anyone whose life depends on trade, status, or control of resources. Even those who dislike [[Manai]] often treat him with cautious respect, the way a town respects fire, storms, or a predator in the hills.

The accord’s worship is not centered on comfort or moral improvement. It is centered on transformation through acquisition. Followers are taught to shed weakness the way a dragon sheds blood in battle, and to replace it with leverage, holdings, and influence. For some, this is spiritual self improvement. For others, it is an excuse to dress greed in sacred language. The faith accommodates both, and it rarely cares which a worshipper truly is so long as they are building a hoard.

Public opinion is complicated by Manai’s connection to dragonkind. Dragons are admired as symbols of majesty and feared as living disasters, and that contradiction bleeds into the accord. People praise dragons on banners, coins, and stories, while also remembering that dragons have taken those same things by force. The accord does not attempt to soften that tension. It leans into it. Manai is not a gentle patron of trade. He is the reason trade exists in the shadow of power.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Warden’s Accord teaches that possession is the truest form of security and that security is the foundation of freedom. Wealth is not treated as a temptation to resist, but as the natural reward of strength, cunning, and will. Destruction is framed as a necessary tool, sometimes literal and sometimes personal, because what is old, weak, or stagnant must be broken to make room for something greater. Followers are encouraged to view the self as a hoard in progress. You tear down what fails, you claim what remains, and you defend it without apology.

The accord does not preach fairness. It preaches results. Charity is not forbidden, but it is measured as investment and reputation rather than mercy. Peace is acceptable if it serves accumulation. War is acceptable if it produces decisive gain. The faithful learn to think like a dragon, not because dragons are noble, but because dragons are powerful.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Greed and Wealth:** Seek fortune and the power that follows it, and treat prosperity as proof of capability rather than a gift to be squandered.
> 
> - **Destruction and Rebirth:** Break what must be broken, in yourself or in the world, because transformation begins where comfort ends.
> 
> - **Power and Domination:** Build influence, enforce boundaries, and do not pretend that strength is optional when others would happily take what you have. Assert your will over others through force and intimidation.
> 
> - **Transformation:** Become something harder to threaten and more difficult to replace, and let every trial sharpen you into a new form.

### Clergy & Worshippers

The accord’s clergy are often indistinguishable from the powerful people they advise. Many serve as bankers, treasurers, trade arbiters, tithe collectors, or judges of commercial disputes. Some are public officiants who bless major deals and handle donations with a careful smile. Others are private counselors to noble houses, coaching patrons on leverage, debt, and how to turn a rival’s ambition into a chain. In places where dragons are present, a few clergy take on the role of negotiators and tribute brokers, mediating between fearful settlements and creatures who view those settlements as potential property.

Worshippers span every class, but devotion looks different depending on what a person can realistically claim. A dockworker might keep a small lockbox and place the first coin of a new job inside as a vow to never return to hunger. A merchant might measure devotion in ledgers and expanding routes, offering a cut of profit in exchange for luck and intimidation. A noble might treat the accord as a justification for conquest, building a household like a hoard and surrounding themselves with visible proof of superiority. True believers tend to respect one another less for prayers spoken and more for what they have built, taken, or held.

Rites are transactional by nature. Tithes are often tied to profit, new holdings, or victories. The faithful may swear private oaths over a pile of coin, a deed, a jeweled dagger, or a signed contract, not because paper is sacred, but because ownership is. The accord’s gatherings can feel like religious services, business meetings, and power displays at the same time, because within this faith those things are closely related.

### Symbols

The primary symbol of the Warden’s Accord is an iridescent dragon scale, usually depicted with a sheen that shifts color depending on the angle of light. It is commonly set against black cloth or dark stone, both to evoke Manai’s title as the Black Warden and to make the scale’s shifting colors feel unnaturally vivid. In temples and formal halls, the scale is often rendered in mosaic, stained glass, or inlaid metal, designed to catch torchlight and make the emblem seem alive as people move past it.

In daily life, the accord favors symbols that can pass as fashion or commerce. Signet rings carry the scale as a tiny stamp, used on wax seals for contracts and letters. Merchants etch it into ledgers, lockboxes, and counter scales as a superstition and a claim of legitimacy. Wealthy devotees commission scale patterned embroidery, jeweled collar pieces, and cloak pins that mimic the shimmer of dragonhide without ever needing to say the god’s name aloud.

Coinage is one of the accord’s most common tools of devotion. In many regions, dragons or dragon motifs appear on currency, and the accord encourages the faithful to treat money itself as a kind of prayer, a thing that moves through the world carrying influence. It is common to seal a major transaction with a small tithe offered immediately after the deal is struck, a ritual meant to invite favorable outcomes and warn unseen rivals that the bargain has teeth. The scale mark is therefore frequently found in banks, counting houses, trade halls, and seats of authority, not as decoration, but as a reminder that power watches the exchange.
