## Overview

The Cult of Oblivion’s Face is the most feared kind of quiet. It rarely presents itself as a church, rarely gathers openly, and almost never tries to persuade the public in any normal way. Most people who have heard of it treat the name like a superstition, something you do not repeat too often, because thinking about [[Komaku]] feels like inviting him closer. When cult activity does surface, it is usually dismissed at first as simple madness or a local tragedy until the pattern becomes undeniable.

The cult survives by staying small, scattered, and hard to prove. Its members do not need temples or public rites. They need privacy, vulnerable minds, and time. A Dreamweaver might embed in a traveling troupe, a hospice, a prison, or a household already strained by grief, insomnia, or fear. Where other dark faiths build influence through leverage and hierarchy, the Cult of Oblivion’s Face spreads through contamination. One person’s nightmare becomes another person’s certainty, and certainty becomes a doorway.

Most followers are not recruited through doctrine. They are found. Some come seeking relief from fear and find that the cult offers a terrible bargain: surrender your sense of what is real, and the pain becomes easier to bear. Others are drawn by power over perception, the ability to reshape a room with a lie so convincing that the victim’s own mind supplies the details. A few are simply broken people who have begun to prefer the dream to waking life and want the world to follow them into it.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The cult teaches that waking reality is only one interpretation, and not the most honest one. Dreams are treated as the mind’s true domain, where fear, desire, memory, and impulse speak without restraint. Komaku is not worshipped as a wise guide or a rightful king, but as proof that meaning is optional and that sanity is a set of habits that can be unlearned. The faithful are encouraged to distrust consistency, to treat certainty as a trap, and to regard fear as a sacred tool that opens the mind to new shapes of thought. In the cult’s worldview, the self is meant to fracture, because a fractured mind cannot be ruled.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Illusion's Dance:** Reality is a tapestry of illusions. Use the power of illusion to weave your own narrative in the waking world.
> 
> - **Madness is Liberation:** Sanity is a cage built by fear of disorder. Break the cage and you will stop begging the world to make sense.
> 
> - **Dreams are Reality:** In the realm of dreams, reality is subjective. Embrace the fluid nature of existence and find truth in the chaos of the mind.
> 
> - **Fear is a Catalyst:** Fear reveals what people protect and what they will become when protection fails. Use fear to transform yourself and others.

### Clergy & Worshippers

The cult has no formal clergy in the way most faiths understand it. Those who lead are called Dreamweavers, not because they are ordained, but because they are capable. A Dreamweaver might be an illusionist, a manipulator, a poisoner, or a soft spoken listener who learns exactly what someone is afraid to admit. Some induce nightmares through rites, drugs, and sleep deprivation. Others use patience, repetition, and whispered certainty until a victim no longer trusts their own memories.

Worshippers come in several familiar shapes. There are the desperate who cannot sleep without terror and decide terror is better than emptiness. There are the curious who chase altered states the way others chase forbidden books. There are the cruel who enjoy the intimate power of convincing someone they are losing their mind. Many drift in and out of devotion, because Komaku’s influence does not demand loyalty so much as it erodes the ability to recognize betrayal, even of oneself.

Cult gatherings, when they happen, are usually small and shifting. A cellar with damp stone, a back room behind a stage, a half abandoned shrine repurposed into a feverish sanctuary. The cult prefers spaces where sound carries oddly and shadows feel uncertain. Rites often revolve around masks, spoken dreams, and shared hallucinations, with members reinforcing one another’s delusions until the group becomes its own reality.

### Symbols

The Cult of Oblivion’s Face uses symbols the way it uses everything else, as a weapon against certainty. Marks are rarely standardized for long, because a fixed sign can be hunted. Cells develop their own motifs, then abandon them the moment they become recognizable. A spiral scratched into wood, a child’s rhyme repeated in chalk, a painted eye that changes position from one night to the next. The point is not identification. The point is to make the observer doubt what they noticed.

When the cult does choose a consistent emblem, it is the mask. An ethereal, nightmarish face with features that seem to rearrange when you look away, often rendered in pale ink against dark cloth, or carved into cheap wood and left where it will be found. Some versions are expressionless. Others grin too widely. Many have mismatched eyes, or one eye that is not an eye at all. Dreamweavers sometimes wear such masks during rites, not as ceremony, but as a tool to break the mind’s need for stable faces.

The mask also appears in subtler forms. A pendant hidden under clothing, a ring stamped on the inside band, a seam pattern stitched into a sleeve, a wax seal pressed onto a letter meant to ruin someone’s sense of what is real. In places where the cult has grown bold, victims report seeing the mask in reflections, in still water, or in the corner of their vision, whether it is truly there or not. The cult treats that uncertainty as a sign of success.
