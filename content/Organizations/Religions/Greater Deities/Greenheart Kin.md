## Overview

The Greenheart Kin is one of the most widely trusted faiths in Faysel, not because it is loud, but because it is _present_. Where there are forests to pass through, wounds to dress, or neighbors to reconcile, a Greenheart will eventually appear. To most common folk, Rambak isn’t an abstract god of “nature.” He’s the reason a blight didn’t take the orchard, the reason the winter stores were shared, and the reason a feud ended before it became blood.

The Kin’s worship is rooted in relationship rather than ritual. Their shrines are wayside groves, their prayers are spoken while working, and their “temples” are often open-air sanctuaries that look more like a community space than a cathedral. The Greenheart Kin teaches that the wild is not separate from civilization, it is the foundation beneath it, and that kinship is not sentimental, it is survival.

That said, the Oakfather is not a gentle god in the way city folk sometimes imagine. The Greenheart Kin offers welcome freely, but it also keeps _reckoning_. Those who burn the wild for convenience, poison rivers for profit, or fracture communities through cruelty and exploitation are treated as threats to the living web Rambak protects. The Kin’s mercy is abundant. Their patience is deep. Their anger is slow. And when it finally moves, it does not miss.

## Culture

### Dogma 

Rambak’s teachings revolve around continuity through connection. Everything living is part of a shared inheritance, soil, seed, shelter, story, and the bonds that keep people from becoming lone, desperate animals. The Greenheart Kin does not demand that mortals reject cities or technology outright. It demands that growth remain responsible, that harvesting be paired with replanting, and that prosperity never come from severing the world’s roots.

They preach that the wild is not “untamed chaos,” but an ancient order older than laws and crowns. To harm it without care is not merely reckless; it is theft from future generations. Likewise, to isolate yourself from others, to refuse community, to treat neighbors as disposable, is to act against the World Tree itself.

> - **Guardians of the Wild:** Protect the places that cannot speak for themselves, and defend the living systems that keep the world breathing.
> 
> - **Kinship and Unity:** Community is a sacred bond; isolation is a wound. Feed your roots by feeding those of your neighbor.
> 
> - **The Wisdom of the Wild:** Seek enlightenment and understanding through the study of nature's cycles and the wisdom found therein.

### Clergy & Worshippers

The Kin’s clergy are often called Greenhearts, though titles vary by region. Some are wardens and guides who keep travelers alive on old forest roads. Others are herbalists, midwives, and healers who serve frontier villages that never see a “proper” temple. Many are mediators, asked to settle disputes because the Kin is seen as less political than nobles and less mercenary than guilds.

Worshippers aren’t defined by a uniform so much as by habits: sharing food without being asked, leaving markers for safe paths, planting where they harvest, and treating strangers like potential family rather than potential enemies. In rural areas, whole communities might be “of the Kin” without ever calling themselves devoted. They simply live the practice.

In cities, the Greenheart Kin tends to be smaller but sharper-edged. Urban Greenhearts are the ones negotiating river rights, fighting to preserve groves, pressuring councils to stop strip-mining, and building mutual-aid networks in poor districts. They are also the ones who end up in conflicts at city borders when expansion turns into swallowing.

### Symbols

The Greenheart symbol is an oak with far-reaching branches and roots, shown as both canopy and foundation. It appears carved into trail stones, burned into the beams of ranger lodges, painted on healing satchels, and stitched into traveling cloaks. In many places, the “symbol” is simply a living oak used as a meeting place, marked with ribbons, votive knots, or small offerings.

Clergy tend toward plant-based and natural materials not as a purity test, but as a statement: _we belong to the living world_. That said, the Kin is rarely dogmatic about clothing. A farmer in wool and leather can honor Rambak as deeply as a druid in bark and leaves. What matters is the relationship you maintain, not the aesthetic you perform.
