## Overview

The Shepherd’s Vigil is the primary faith devoted to [[Castor]], practiced wherever roads are long, nights are dangerous, and people still look to the sky for guidance. It is widely regarded as a benevolent institution, not because it promises safety, but because it offers preparation, counsel, and quiet protection. Shrines and wayshrines maintained by the Vigil are common along trade routes, mountain passes, and coastal roads, serving as both religious markers and practical shelters for travelers.

The Vigil’s institutional heart is in [[Crossroads]], a fitting seat for a church defined by movement and navigation. From there, its influence spreads through observatories, roadside sanctuaries, and small chapters embedded in towns that depend on caravans, sailors, or seasonal migration. While it maintains shared practices and recognized ranks, the Vigil is not rigidly centralized. Local chapters answer to regional elders and keep their own watch according to local threats, terrain, and custom.

Politically, the Shepherd’s Vigil tends to be trusted and invited rather than feared. It rarely seeks formal authority, but it becomes influential through its presence at the margins of civilization, where warnings, maps, and reliable escorts matter more than speeches. In courts and councils, the Vigil is often treated as a stabilizing force, especially when roads are threatened by monsters, banditry, or worse. Its tension with more aggressive institutions is usually philosophical. 

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Shepherd’s Vigil teaches that the night is not evil, but it is where evil hides. Wisdom is pursued not as raw knowledge, but as understanding earned through observation, reflection, and lived experience. Followers are called to guide those who travel, to preserve what is learned, and to keep watch when others sleep. Castor does not promise a clear road. He promises that no one must walk blind.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Lunar Wisdom:** Seek wisdom and enlightenment through the study of the heavens and the mysteries of the cosmos, for they will light your path.
> 
> - **Guiding Light:** Aid travelers in their journeys, especially during the night and uncertain times. Offer a guiding light on their way.
> 
> - **Eternal Vigilance:** Stand watch against threats that grow in shadow, whether monsters, corruption, or complacency, and answer danger with discipline.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Castor’s clergy are commonly called Starguides. They include astronomers, scholars, rangers, caravanners, sailors, shepherds, sages, and guardian monks. Many chapters maintain observatories and libraries, keeping star charts, road records, and local threat ledgers that are shared with trusted travelers. Others operate as wardens of night roads, escorting caravans, patrolling borders, and investigating disappearances that follow moonless weeks.

Worshippers are drawn from any walk of life touched by travel or night work. Pilgrims, merchants, hunters, messengers, and ordinary families who live far from city walls often keep Castor close. Devotion is usually practical. A prayer before departure, a coin left at a wayshrine, a story shared beneath a roof marked with the Vigil’s sign.

### Symbols

The Vigil’s symbol is a silver crescent moon crowning a shepherd’s crook, often displayed on midnight blue cloth or carved into pale stone. Many followers wear it as a pendant or on a ring, and it is frequently etched into the lintels of roadside sanctuaries.

Silver holds special significance within the Vigil, associated with moonlight and the old belief that certain evils recoil from it. Starguides often carry silvered tokens, small charms, or practical silvered tools, both as devotion and as warding. In some traditions, the Vigil also preserves the rumor that the moon itself is formed of [[Moon Silver]], a claim treated as myth by some and as sacred truth by others.

There is no universal uniform. Starguides dress according to the road and the season, though dark travel cloaks, star stitched hems, and discreet silver accents are common among those who serve openly. At observatories and temples, symbolism becomes more pronounced, but still restrained. The Vigil prefers signs that endure weather and distance over ornament meant to impress at close range.
