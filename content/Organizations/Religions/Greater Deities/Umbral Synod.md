## Overview

The Umbral Synod is the primary faith devoted to [[Xalzotec]], operating in secrecy across [[Faysel]]. Though outlawed in many lands, its worship persists precisely because it is difficult to trace. The synod does not gather in open plazas or grand cathedrals. It survives in hidden chambers, beneath cities, within private estates, and in the quiet spaces where secrets are exchanged and never spoken of again.

The cult draws members from every walk of life. Nobles seeking leverage, scholars pursuing forbidden knowledge, assassins perfecting their craft, and the desperate searching for power beyond mortality all find a place within its shadows. To outsiders, the synod is regarded as malevolent and corrupting. To its followers, it is simply honest about the darkness that already exists in the world.

Unlike faiths that seek broad conversion, the Umbral Synod values discretion over numbers. It spreads through whispers, through shared guilt, through secrets traded for protection. Its influence is rarely obvious, but it is often present where trust fails and blood is quietly spilled.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Umbral Synod teaches that darkness is not a flaw in creation but a necessary and potent force. Every soul carries hidden desire, fear, and ambition. To deny this is weakness. To master it is power. Night is revered not as absence, but as opportunity. In shadow, one may act without judgment, learn without interference, and shape fate without spectacle.

Sacrifice stands at the center of its theology. Power must be paid for. Blood willingly offered carries greater weight than blood taken by force, and the act of sacrifice binds the devotee to Xalzotec in ways that cannot easily be undone. Secrets are treated as sacred currency. Knowledge withheld is power preserved. Knowledge revealed carelessly is power wasted.

Undeath is viewed as an escape from limitation. Where other faiths treat death as passage, the synod treats it as a barrier to overcome. Through ritual, pact, and devotion, followers seek exemption from mortality, even if that exemption demands eternal dependence.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Offerings of Sacrifice:** Show devotion through acts of sacrifice, whether of comfort, blood, or life. Power requires payment.
>
> - **Embrace the Night**: Act with comfort in darkness, both within yourself and in the world. Night is a cloak and a teacher.
>
> - **Pursuit of Secrets:** Seek hidden knowledge and protect what you learn. Secrets are strength and must not be squandered.
>
> - **Silent wings:** Move unseen and unheard. Let your presence be known only when it serves your purpose. Bats are revered as messengers and symbols of Xalzotec's prescence. 

### Clergy & Worshippers

The clergy of the Umbral Synod are known as Dusk Disciples. They serve as recruiters, ritual leaders, and keepers of knowledge. Many live double lives as merchants, officials, scholars, or artisans. Their authority comes not from public recognition but from the secrets they hold and the sacrifices they have made.

Initiation into the synod culminates in a ritual baptism. The initiate cuts their wrists and steps into a basin or pool of blood while swearing oaths of secrecy and loyalty. An officiant seals the rite with invocation and mark. From that moment forward, the initiate is bound not only by faith, but by complicity.

Worshippers range widely. Some seek protection for illicit pursuits. Others seek immortality through undeath. Many are drawn by ambition or fear of obscurity. The synod does not demand constant public devotion. It demands effectiveness, secrecy, and loyalty. 

### Symbols

The most recognized symbol of the Umbral Synod is a stylized bat silhouette with wings outstretched, often displayed against a black field. In truth, overt symbols are rare. The cult favors ambiguity and layered meaning.

Marks scratched into wood or stone may be genuine signals or deliberate misdirection. Rings, sigils, and motifs may carry meaning only to a single pair of members. Many false symbols are spread intentionally to confuse outsiders and protect deeper networks.

In synod sanctuaries, imagery of bats, wings, and flowing blood appears in mosaics and carvings, usually in dim light and shadowed halls. Outside those spaces, the greatest symbol of the synod is absence itself. What cannot be proven cannot be confronted.
