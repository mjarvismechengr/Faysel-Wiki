## Overview
Worship of [[Castor]] is very common, as his domain casts a wide net. Among the general populous, the Church of Castor is seen as a benevolent entity, offering blessings during travel, protection from evil, and even just deeper wisdom. People flock to worship Castor counting on his goodness and the vigilant protection of his followers. 

## Culture
### Dogma 
Castor's teachings revolve around the pursuit of wisdom, the guidance of travelers, and the eternal vigilance against the encroachment of darkness. Followers are encouraged to seek wisdom (not necessarily knowledge), and to be ever-watchful against the threats that lurk in the shadows. 

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Lunar Wisdom:** Seek wisdom and enlightenment through the study of the heavens and the mysteries of the cosmos, for they will light your path.
> - **Guiding Light:** Aid travelers in their journeys, especially during the night. Offering a guiding light on their way.
> - **Eternal Vigilance:** Stand against the dangers of darkness, guarding the realms from threats that seek to obscure the light.

### Clergy & Worshippers
Castor's clergy, known as Starguides, often include astronomers, scholars, rangers, caravanners, shepherds, sages, and guardian monks. They maintain observatories and host gatherings where stories of travels and starlore are shared. They maintain observatories and wayshrines, guiding travelers and stargazers alike. They also serve as guardians of the night, seeking out agents of darkness and dispatching of them.

### Symbols
Because Starguides include people from all walks of life there is no specified clothing worn among all. Most, however, wear or carry Castor's holy symbol, a silver crescent moon crowning a shepherd's crook, as a pendant, on a ring, or some other form of silver jewelry. 

> The common symbol of Castor's church is a silver crescent moon crowning a shepherd's crook, generally displayed on a midnight blue tapestry. 

The metal silver is heavily associated with Castor and the moon. It holds the ability to harm, repel, and even trap some evil monsters, though exactly why is hotly debated amongst sages. Because of this property it is popular with monster hunters and simple travelers alike. Even those who do not hold particular reverence for the god of the moon often carry a bit of silver hoping to ward off the evils within the shadows. It is also rumored that the moon is actually made entirely of a magical silver known as [[Moon Silver]].

## History
### Holy Days

- **The Starlit Pilgrimage:** A journey once every 5 years to a sacred celestial site, where pilgrims travel only by night to honor Castor and seek his guidance.

- **Festival of the Blood Moon:** Every Autumn, the moon turns a rusty orange color. This marks the end of the growing season and heart of autumn. Followers gather in the fields to bring in the harvest, sharing stories and songs. The day includes a grand feast where the community comes together to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and giving thanks for a plentiful harvest. Games of skill and chance, such as apple-bobbing and cornhusking competitions, are common. Priests offer blessings to ensure a bountiful harvest next year. This is a celebration for [[Castor]], [[Calypso]], and [[Solara]]. Followers are encouraged to be constantly vigilant.

- **Stellar Alignment:** A rare celestial event when certain stars / planets align, seen as a day of prophecy and deep cosmic understanding.

- **Moonlit Communion:** Celebrated on nights of the full moon, when followers gather to share knowledge, stories, and conduct celestial observations. More valiant followers may spend full moons hunting creatures of the night, or guiding people.

### Holy Sites
Temples dedicated to Castor often include observatories and shrines where travelers and seekers of wisdom gather. They are often tranquil, open-air sanctuaries under the night sky. They are places of quiet reflection and meditation, lit by the gentle glow of star lamps. In addition to temples, wayshrines frequently dot roads and trails, hoping to guide and protect fellow travelers.
