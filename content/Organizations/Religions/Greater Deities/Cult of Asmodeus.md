## Overview

The Church of Asmodeus is the dominant and most organized expression of devil worship in [[Faysel]], devoted to [[Asmodeus]], Lord of the Nine Hells. Wherever mortals knowingly enter into infernal pacts, their devotion ultimately traces back to him. Even when cults claim loyalty to lesser archdevils, their authority is derived from Asmodeus himself, whose supremacy over the infernal hierarchy is absolute.

On the [[Material Plane]], his cult operates most often in secret. In major cities, particularly those with complex legal systems and entrenched political structures, Asmodean cells embed themselves within existing institutions rather than confronting them directly. In rare regions where his worship is tolerated, temples may stand openly, though their internal dealings remain guarded.

The church is not anarchic or frenzied in its devotion. It is structured, deliberate, and contractual. Leadership is earned through influence and maintained through leverage. Authority flows upward, mirroring the infernal hierarchy itself. All pacts, blessings, and infernal powers are understood to be granted at Asmodeus’s discretion, whether acknowledged directly or filtered through layers of devils and intermediaries.

## Culture

### Dogma

The cult teaches that power is not seized through chaos but secured through structure. Authority is maintained through law, precision, and the disciplined use of speech. Contracts and pacts are sacred instruments, binding mortal desire into enforceable hierarchy. Followers are instructed to pursue advantage through calculated agreements, ensuring that every exchange strengthens their position and advances the will of the Lord of the Nine Hells. Everything has its place. Chaos is the enemy of control.
 
> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - Dominion Through Subjugation: Hierarchy is natural. The capable rise; the incapable serve. Power is derived from order and control. Establish your dominion through strategic manipulation and control.
> 
> - Contracts are Chains of Power: Binding contracts are the foundation of control. Craft contracts that serve your ambitions and exploit the desires of others. Fulfill your obligations and exploit the weaknesses of those who fail.
> 
> - Cunning in All Things: Embrace intelligence, deceit, and guile as powerful tools in the pursuit of one's goals. Seek out forbidden knowledge and arcane secrets.  A silver tongue can solve many issues.
> 
> - Ambition Knows No Bounds: Never settle for mediocrity. Set lofty goals and strive for power, wealth, and influence at any cost. No ambition is too grand.

### Clergy & Worshippers

The clergy of Asmodeus consists less of robed priests and more of negotiators, legalists, warlocks, financiers, and political operatives. Many present themselves publicly as civic leaders, advisors, magistrates, or even orthodox devotees of [[Cyrus]], whose domain of law provides convenient cover. Their strength lies in discretion and persuasion rather than spectacle.

Worshippers range from desperate individuals seeking escape from weakness to calculated aristocrats pursuing influence beyond mortal limits. Advancement within the cult depends on demonstrated cunning, successful pacts, and the accumulation of leverage over others. Failure is rarely forgiven, and incompetence is quietly removed.

Meetings are typically private and invitation only. Oaths are spoken in measured tones, recorded meticulously, and enforced without exception. Devotion is proven through results.

### Symbols

Open regalia is uncommon in most regions of Faysel, as public devotion to Asmodeus is widely condemned. Subtle markers are preferred. Rings bearing the infernal sigil, pendants concealed beneath clothing, or carefully arranged geometric motifs may indicate affiliation to those trained to recognize them.

The most common symbol associated with the cult is three inverted triangles arranged in a long triangular formation. In discreet settings this emblem may be etched into wax seals, engraved into signet rings, or incorporated into architectural details.

For formal rites, high ranking members wear deep red robes, often hooded and intentionally uniform to obscure identity. In territories where Asmodean worship is permitted, temples display opulence and wealth, emphasizing order, luxury, and the visible fruits of ambition. Even there, however, the most consequential negotiations take place behind closed doors.
