## Overview

The Creed of Blight and Balm is feared far more often than it is loved, but it is rarely ignored. Where other faiths offer comfort, the Creed offers competence, and in a world where plague and poison exist, competence becomes its own kind of sanctuary. In most cities the Creed maintains a visible face, apothecaries, fever wards, herbal markets, and traveling physicians, and a hidden face, quiet laboratories, restricted texts, and rites conducted behind sealed doors. Most people encounter the first and pray they never meet the second.

Public devotion is uncommon. Many will leave coin, a bundle of herbs, or a small votive at a Creed doorway, not out of affection, but out of anxiety. Pestilina is widely regarded as a god you acknowledge so she looks past you. This uneasy relationship is precisely what gives the Creed its reach. Even those who despise the Plague Maiden know that when sickness spreads or venom appears in a well, someone in the Creed may be the only person who understands what is happening.

Within the faith, that discomfort is treated as proof of truth. Life, they say, is not clean. Healing is not pure. Survival is not gentle. The Creed’s work sits at the seam where mercy and cruelty become hard to distinguish, and it attracts people willing to live there, whether out of devotion, obsession, pragmatism, or hunger for power.

## Culture

### Dogma 

The Creed teaches that affliction is not a violation of nature but one of its sharpest instruments. Disease thins, reshapes, and hardens. Famine reveals which societies are brittle and which are resilient. Poison is simply medicine with intent and dosage changed. To the Creed, these are not moral categories. They are mechanisms. A body is tested. A community adapts or collapses. A cure is discovered or a lesson is learned the long way.

Pestilina’s followers are expected to accept duality without flinching. A healer who cannot stomach suffering is ineffective. An alchemist who refuses the possibility of harm is ignorant. The Creed does not praise pain for its own sake, but it does insist that pain is instructive, and that denying it only guarantees it will return worse. Even acts of healing are framed as selection and consequence. You do not simply save a life. You intervene in a process, and you must be willing to pay whatever follows.

> <u>**Tenets:**</u>
> - **Embrace the Cycle:** Life, decay, recovery, and death are inseparable, and denying one invites ruin in another.
> 
> - **Survival of the Fittest:** Endurance and adaptation are virtues proven under pressure, not promised by prayer.
> 
> - **Respect Famine:** Scarcity is a crucible that reveals weakness and forces ingenuity, and it must be understood, not sentimentalized
> 
> - **Alchemy's Art:** Study both toxin and antidote, because knowledge that cannot harm is knowledge that cannot truly heal.
> 
> - **Vermin's Place:** Even the smallest scavengers have purpose in the cycle, and contempt for them is contempt for reality.

### Clergy & Worshippers

Those who serve the Creed are commonly called Plague Doctors, though the title is broader than the mask and coat the public imagines. Some are ward-keepers who manage fever houses and triage lines. Some are apothecaries and herbalists whose shops smell of vinegar, smoke, and crushed leaves. Some are field physicians who travel between villages with stitched satchels of tinctures and bone needles, arriving when others will not. Others work far from public view as alchemists, toxin-brewers, and researchers who treat an outbreak like a scripture to be read.

The faithful are a strange mix. There are true believers drawn to Pestilina’s philosophy of endurance, people who see survival as sacred precisely because it is costly. There are opportunists who want the power that poisons provide. There are obsessives who cannot stop learning, and pragmatists who simply want to keep their families alive in harsh regions. A few worshippers come to the Creed after losing everything to disease and deciding that if they cannot control fate, they will at least understand it.

Within the Creed, status tends to follow results. A cure discovered, a new venom perfected, a famine mitigated in a way that strengthened a community, these are achievements that matter. Moral arguments carry little weight compared to outcomes. The Creed is not unified on how freely cures should be given or how often suffering should be permitted to “teach.” That tension is not treated as schism. It is treated as debate between two hands of the same god.

### Symbols

The Creed’s primary symbol is a staff wound with two snakes, one representing venom and one representing remedy. It is displayed in places where the Creed wants to be found, on clinic doors, medical satchels, mortar and pestle stamps, and the wax seals of physicians who travel under the faith’s protection. In prosperous districts it may be rendered in polished metal. In poorer places it is often scratched into wood or painted quickly on cloth, as much a ward as a sign.

Dress is the Creed’s loudest language, and it changes with purpose. Those working openly often wear practical work garments marked with the symbol somewhere easy to see, a patch, a pin, a stamped clasp, because visibility discourages interference. In times of outbreak, many adopt the traditional plague-doctor silhouette, layered coats, gloves, and beaked masks packed with bitter herbs and charcoal, both as protection and as warning. During rites tied to famine and blight, some members don tattered robes and ash-stained veils, making themselves look half-starved on purpose as an act of reverence and reminder.

To the public, the symbol provokes opposite reactions depending on context. On a healer’s door, it means hope. On a sealed laboratory, it means dread. The Creed accepts both. They consider revulsion a kind of honesty, the same honesty Pestilina demands from the world.
