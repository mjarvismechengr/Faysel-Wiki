## Overview

The Carpenters’ Guild is a widespread professional association of woodworkers, builders, and artisans whose halls can be found in most major cities across [[Faysel]]. Though often spoken of as a single unified body, the guild operates through largely independent local chapters that adhere to shared standards of training, craft, and conduct. This loose structure allows the guild to maintain a recognizable identity across continents while adapting to regional materials, architectural traditions, and cultural aesthetics.

Guild members are responsible for far more than structural framing and construction. They shape ships’ hulls along the coasts of the [[Siren Sea]], carve temple reliefs in the river cities of [[Aequitorra]], craft intricate joinery in the urban centers influenced by the [[Candelabra]]’s patronage, and produce both functional and ornamental works for noble houses and common folk alike. Wood carving, cabinetry, furniture making, architectural ornamentation, and restoration of historic structures all fall within their domain. In many settlements, the guild hall doubles as a workshop, apprenticeship center, and public contract office, reinforcing its role as both trade institution and civic contributor.

Apprenticeship lies at the heart of the guild’s structure. Young workers train under established masters, learning not only technical skill but also the traditions of wood selection, preservation, and design philosophy particular to their region. Advancement is based on demonstrated craftsmanship rather than lineage or political favor, and a finished masterwork often serves as the final proof of competence. Despite regional variation, guild insignia and certification marks are recognized broadly, allowing traveling carpenters to find work and trust beyond their home city.

Politically, the Carpenters’ Guild tends to remain pragmatic and nonpartisan. It answers to local authorities where required and pays dues or taxes like any other organized trade, but it rarely involves itself directly in ideological disputes. Its influence is practical rather than overt. Cities rely on its members for infrastructure, repair, and expansion, granting the guild quiet leverage in matters of urban planning and resource allocation. In frontier regions or rapidly growing settlements, the presence of a guild hall often signals stability and long term investment.

Religiously, devotion varies by region. In Thrane, many guild members formally revere [[Cyrus]] as patron of order and lawful construction, viewing sound structure as a reflection of just governance. In communities shaped by the cycles of growth and harvest, quiet homage is sometimes given to [[Calypso]] for the life drawn from timber and the renewal of forests. Such observances are typically personal rather than institutional. The guild itself does not function as a religious body, but its work carries an implicit respect for the materials it shapes.

One constant across continents is the guild’s pursuit of rare and exotic woods. Explorers, merchants, and ship captains often find reliable buyers among its ranks. Specimens from the deep jungles of northern [[Aequitorra]], the mist-laden reaches of the [[Endor Forest]], or distant islands across the [[Blood Sea]] command high prices, especially when suitable for artistic or structural innovation. In this way, the Carpenters’ Guild quietly participates in global trade networks, linking distant forests to courts, cathedrals, and ships across the world.
