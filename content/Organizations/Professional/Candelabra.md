## Overview

The Candelabra is the most influential magical organization in the known world, governing the study, application, and even in some ways the regulation of magic. It presents itself as a neutral institution dedicated to advancing magical knowledge, mediating political disputes, and preventing the misuse of dangerous magic. Its influence reaches into the courts of kings, the research of scholars, and the clandestine dealings of powerful factions.

The guild is composed of nine Archmages, each overseeing a distinct realm of magical expertise, and their respective towers spread across the world. The tenth and greatest of these towers, [[Ixaghor]], serves as the guild’s headquarters and seat of power.

Though the Candelabra does not officially govern, its subtle influence guides and shapes the world, ensuring that no one, mage or monarch, wields power unchecked. While some within the guild genuinely believe in protecting civilization, others use their position to hoard knowledge, manipulate events, and serve their own ambitions.
