## Overview

Morbrand Mercantile stands as one of the largest private trading and protection enterprises on the continent of [[Isomar]].  Part merchant empire, part standing army, and part intelligence network, the Company sells _security, supply, and subtlety_ to any crown or caravan that can meet its price. Publicly, they are a respected shipping consortium ensuring goods move safely through pirate-haunted seas and bandit-ridden roads. Privately, they traffic in monopolies, political leverage, and quiet intimidation, though proving this another matter entirely. 

Their fleets are sleek, black-hulled, and heavily armed; their overland caravans move with military precision. The Morbrands value reputation above law. Rhey deliver what they promise, even when the cost is blood.

## Culture

**Recruitment:**
They hire veterans, sailors, and outcasts seeking purpose; anyone who can fight, sail, or count coin. Loyalty is bought through contracts, bonuses, and prestige. Exceptional agents may rise rapidly if they bring profit or influence.

### Uniforms & Symbols

- **Emblem:** a silver serpent coiled around a golden coin.
    
- **Colors:** black and brass.
    
- Officers wear tailored black coats with serpent clasps; mercenary divisions bear the sigil on shields and banners.

## History

Founded less than a century ago by [[Elias Morbrand]], a former privateer turned shipping magnate, the Company began as a single fleet safeguarding caravans on the [[Siren Coast]]. Through ruthless efficiency and shrewd alliances, it grew into a continent-spanning trade powerhouse. The Morbrands earned their reputation when their private navy crushed a pirate coalition and reopened the [[Blood Sea]] routes at a price so high that several coastal towns still owe them tribute. Today, Morbrand Mercantile straddles the line between enterprise and empire: too rich to be outlawed, too necessary to be destroyed, and far too ambitious to stay content with trade alone.
