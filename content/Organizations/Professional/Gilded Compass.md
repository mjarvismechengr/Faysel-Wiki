## Overview

The Gilded Compass is a disciplined adventuring company that operates along the [[Siren Coast]] and the frontier roads of Thrane. They are known for approaching problems like a military unit rather than a band of fortune-seekers. They travel with clear procedure, maintain strict internal standards, and keep detailed records of every agreement, outcome, and casualty. In taverns and guildhalls their name carries a particular reputation: if the Compass accepts a job, it will be completed, and it will be completed cleanly.

The company is led by Sir [[Caldus Vayne]], a former knight who still carries the posture and expectations of the orders he left behind. Under his command, the Compass frames adventuring as service without subservience. They do not pledge themselves to a crown, but they do hold themselves to a code. 

The strength of the Gilded Compass lies in its balance of roles and temperaments. Its members are built to function together under pressure: a steadfast front line, a specialist in control and protection, a wilderness warden capable of meeting savagery with savagery, and a duelist whose gifts pull at forces none of the others fully trust. This cohesion is reinforced by constant training and an internal culture that values discipline over charisma. They are not warm, and they are not intimate. They are professional, and they are reliable.
