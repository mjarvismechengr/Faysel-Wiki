## Overview

The Iron Hills Mining Co. is a large scale extraction company operating across the [[Iron Hills]] near the center of the [[Gold Grass Prairie]]. Unlike smaller regional ventures, the company maintains multiple active claims at once, moving crews, equipment, and contracted labor between sites as veins are discovered, depleted, or abandoned. Its presence has shaped both the landscape and the settlements of the region for generations.

The company functions as a centralized commercial enterprise. Decisions regarding claims, expansion, and closure are made by a governing board and senior foremen, with site supervisors enforcing quotas and safety standards in the field. While nominally subject to the laws of whatever jurisdiction controls a given claim, the company’s economic weight grants it significant leverage in practice. Towns such as [[Meliard]] owe much of their growth and instability to the company’s shifting priorities.

Its workforce is diverse, composed of dwarves, humans, kobolds, and others willing to endure the hazards of deep shaft mining and open pit extraction. Employment is steady but rarely secure. Crews relocate frequently, following ore rather than roots, and communities form around productivity more than permanence. Advancement is tied to output and reliability, though favoritism and internal politics are not unknown.
