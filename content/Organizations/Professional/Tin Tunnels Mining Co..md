## Overview

The Tin Tunnels Mining Co. is a dwarven operated extraction company based in the coastal region of [[Seabrook]] on the continent of [[Isomar]]. Its primary site, the [[Tin Tunnels Mine]], lies a few miles east of the [[Shepherd's Highway]], carved into the low hills north of town. Though originally chartered for tin, the operation has become known for its productive silver veins, drawing steady trade and political attention to the area.

A small fortified settlement has grown around the mine entrance, housing miners, engineers, smelters, guards, and their families. Stone barracks, reinforced storehouses, and timber framed workshops reflect a practical frontier ethos shaped by both dwarven discipline and coastal necessity. The company maintains its own security force to protect shipments traveling along the Shepherd's Highway, particularly as traffic between Seabrook and inland territories increases.

While dwarven in leadership and culture, the company is not formally tied to the greater strongholds found within the [[Duchy of Stonehearth]]. It operates as a semi independent commercial enterprise, answering primarily to its investors and internal charter rather than to a crowned lord. That independence has allowed it to adapt quickly to regional politics, though it also places the burden of defense and stability squarely on its own shoulders.

The company is led by [[Manistrad Copperlocks]], an iron willed dwarven matron who oversees operations from the [[Tin Tunnels Mining Office (Seabrook)]]. A veteran of earlier conflicts and a capable engineer in her own right, Manistrad is convinced that the current silver veins are only the surface signs of richer deposits buried deeper within the rock. Her public support for annexation by [[Kingdom of Thrane|Thrane]] reflects a broader corporate interest in securing trade routes and stabilizing the region for long term growth.

The company maintains a pragmatic relationship with local governance and trade networks. It answers primarily to its charter and investors, cooperating with the [[Seabrook Town Council]] while guarding its operational independence. Religious practice among its members tends to be personal rather than institutional, often reflecting traditional dwarven reverence for law, endurance, and well ordered craft.
