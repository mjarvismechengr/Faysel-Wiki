## Overview

> “Faith is the edge that evil cannot dull.”

The Order of Saint Kyren is a tight-knit brotherhood of holy-minded crusaders dedicated to justice, discipline, and the defense of the innocent. They stand as the shield of [[Isomar]]'s civilization and the sword of faith against darkness. Bound by oath and ritual, its members believe that righteous order is the foundation of peace and that mercy must never undermine duty. Their influence extends beyond the battlefield. They serve as judges, mediators, and saints-in-training across Isomar. Within the [[Kingdom of Thrane]], their presence is both a comfort and a warning: when the Order rides, justice follows close behind.
