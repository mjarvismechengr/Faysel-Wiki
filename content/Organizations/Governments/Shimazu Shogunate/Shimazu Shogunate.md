## Overview

The Shimazu Shogunate (島津幕府) is a powerful feudal military government that rules the island nation of [[Yoseju]]. Its authority rests with [[Clan Shimazu]], whose bloodline has held the title of shogun for over four centuries. The current ruler, [[Tadanori Shimazu]], governs through a careful balance of martial dominance, political tradition, and ritualized authority.

Beneath the shogun stand four great vassal clans: [[Clan Akagi]], [[Clan Ishikawa]], [[Clan Sakai]], and [[Clan Takeda]]. Each controls its own lands and armies while owing fealty to the Shimazu line. Though united in name, rivalry between these clans is constant, expressed through political maneuvering, formal challenges, and struggles for prestige.

Yoseju is a land shaped by order and discipline. Its people believe that society, like a blade, must be carefully forged, maintained, and wielded with intention. Stability is valued above comfort, and tradition above innovation. The shogunate’s banner, a cherry tree in bloom upon a black field, reflects this philosophy: beauty exists only because of restraint.

To outsiders, the Shimazu Shogunate appears rigid and uncompromising. To its people, it is a bulwark against chaos, barbarism, and the collapse of civilization.

## Culture

Life under the Shimazu Shogunate is governed by a strict philosophical code known as Kagetsu no Michi, often translated as _The Way of Blossoms and Steel_. This doctrine teaches that refinement and violence are not opposites, but complements. A warrior must cultivate both discipline of the body and clarity of the mind, just as a ruler must balance mercy with decisiveness.

Society is highly stratified. At its peak stands the shogun, followed by the daimyō who rule in his name. Beneath them are the samurai caste, sworn warriors trained from youth in martial and philosophical pursuits. Monks, scholars, artisans, and merchants serve vital roles within the state, while peasants form the agricultural backbone that sustains it.

Honor is not a personal feeling but a public state. One’s reputation reflects not only on the individual, but on their family and clan. Disgrace is remembered longer than death, and redemption often demands sacrifice.

Magic is respected but tightly controlled. Certain bloodlines possess supernatural gifts believed to be ancestral in nature, but unregulated sorcery is viewed as destabilizing and dangerous. Magical study is permitted only under the supervision of sanctioned orders or clan authorities.

### The Art of the Blade and the Bowl

Within Yoseju, mastery of the sword alone is considered incomplete. The same discipline demanded in combat is expected in all crafts, none more symbolically important than cooking.

To prepare food is to demonstrate patience, precision, and respect for form. A poorly prepared meal is seen as a failure of character, while a carefully crafted dish is an expression of control and intent. Among the nobility, banquets are as much political tools as they are celebrations, and a cook’s reputation may carry as much weight as a general’s.

Legends tell of rival clans resolving some disputes not through battle, but through ritualized culinary competitions, where victory is claimed through balance, presentation, and technical perfection. In this way, conflict is refined rather than erased.

### Faith and Philosophy

The spiritual foundation of the Shimazu Shogunate is the worship of [[Rodikar]], revered not as a god of unrestrained violence, but as the divine ideal of perfected warfare. To the people of Yoseju, Rodikar is the war-god of discipline, foresight, and mastery earned through relentless refinement.

Where others see Rodikar as the embodiment of savage strength, the shogunate teaches that his true divinity lies in control. He is honored as a warrior-monk and supreme general, one who conquered not through rage alone, but through patience, preparation, and absolute command of both self and battlefield.

This belief is inseparable from Kagetsu no Michi, the Way of Blossoms and Steel. War, like art or philosophy, is seen as a path toward enlightenment. Every strike must have purpose. Every campaign must have intention. Victory achieved without discipline is considered hollow, and violence without control is viewed as a failure to truly understand Rodikar’s teachings.

Monastic orders devoted to Rodikar exist throughout Yoseju, training warrior-scholars who study strategy, meditation, calligraphy, and history alongside martial forms. To these monks, battle is a sacred text written in motion, and Rodikar is both its author and final judge.

## History

### The Rise of the Shogunate

Before the Shimazu Shogunate, Yoseju was fractured into warring domains ruled by feuding hobgoblin warlords. Generations of conflict ravaged the islands, with no single leader able to impose lasting order.

This era ended with the rise of [[Ryūnosuke Shimazu]], a general of exceptional tactical insight and personal prowess. Through a combination of conquest, alliance, and calculated mercy, he dismantled rival powers and unified the isles under a single banner.

His final challenge came from [[Harunobu Takeda]], whose defeat at the [[Battle of the Crimson Hills]] sealed Shimazu supremacy. With that victory, Ryūnosuke declared himself shogun, and the great clans swore fealty to his line.

The shogunate has endured for four centuries, surviving internal strife, succession crises, and external threats through rigid adherence to tradition and controlled evolution of power.

### The Holy War with the Dimaheim Horde

For generations, the Shimazu Shogunate has been locked in an ongoing struggle with the peoples of [[Dimaheim]]. The conflict centers on a contested island and the volcanic peak known as [[Mt. Mertari]], a site believed to hold profound spiritual importance.

At the center of the conflict lies an ancient prophecy shared, though interpreted differently, by both peoples:

> _“When the Red Peak bleeds,  
> the Chosen of Rodikar  
> shall take the Sanguine Throne,  
> and the War-God shall return.”_

Each culture believes control of Mt. Mertari will determine the meaning and outcome of this prophecy, ensuring that the war, for now, has no end.

To Yoseju, Mt. Mertari is the ultimate proving ground. Its possession represents not conquest, but validation. Holding the mountain is seen as proof that Rodikar favors discipline over savagery, foresight over frenzy, and mastery over instinct.

The shogunate teaches that Rodikar’s return, whatever form it may take, will be guided by wisdom and tested through perfect execution of war. Control of the mountain is therefore essential, not only to deny it to their rivals, but to demonstrate Yoseju’s spiritual legitimacy.
