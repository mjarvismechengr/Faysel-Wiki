## Overview

The Kingdom of Thrane stands as the oldest and most unified realm on the continent of [[Isomar]] as a bastion of law, order, and divine justice. Founded upon the teachings of [[Cyrus]], God of Law and Honor, Thrane embodies a society built on structure, discipline, and duty to crown and faith alike.

Its shining capital, [[Independence]], rises as the heart of both government and religion, where King [[Lytharion Solmara]] rules as monarch. Beneath him lie five duchies: The [[Duchy of Dolm]], The [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]], The [[Duchy of Stonehearth]], The [[Duchy of Valorden]], and The [[Duchy of Stillhold]]; each governed by a Duke or Duchess bound by oath to uphold the Crown’s decrees.

Thrane’s strength lies not only in its disciplined armies or vast bureaucracy but in its unwavering belief in the sanctity of law. Every oath sworn, every judgment rendered, is seen as an act of divine order. Despite its stability, Thrane is not without shadow. Corruption festers behind gilded walls, ambition whispers in council halls, and an unseen cult seeks to undermine its perfect symmetry from within. Thrane endures as a beacon of civilization in a turbulent world, yet even the brightest light can cast the longest shadow.

## Culture

Thranish culture is defined by law, honor, and feudal hierarchy, a structured society that prizes discipline and loyalty above all. Nobles and commoners alike are raised to believe that peace and prosperity flow from order, not chaos; from law, not liberty.

The [[Church of Cyrus]] sits at the moral center of this order. Oaths, contracts, marriages, and even military commissions are sworn upon [[Cyrus]]’ name. A broken oath is not only a legal offense but a spiritual stain.

### Core Tenets

- **Law is Sacred.** Obedience to lawful authority is both civic and divine duty.
    
- **Honor in Action.** Integrity in word and deed defines the worth of a citizen.
    
- **Peace Through Structure.** Harmony is maintained through ranks, rituals, and just hierarchy.
    
- **Oaths Bind the Soul.** A promise is a contract with the divine.
    

### Hierarchy and Ranks

1. **King** – supreme sovereign, arbiter of justice, and high protector of the faith.

### Uniforms and Symbols

The national colors, white and gold, represent purity and divine order. Soldiers in the army of Thrane wear the King’s Pattern: white tabards trimmed with gold and marked on the chest with the symbol of Thrane: golden scales balanced on a sword. 

The armies of each duchy adapt this design by altering the trim color: orange in Dolm, green in Vaelwyth, crimson in Stonehearth, blue in Valorden, and purple in Stillhold. They also add the symbol of their house as a small patch in a corner of the tabard or on a shoulder of other clothing.  

Guards and watchmen wear the Baron's emblem over city colors.

### Convocation of Crowns

The feudal lattice is underpinned by the Convocation of Crowns, a royal council composed of the King, the five dukes, and high officers of war, faith, and administration.
