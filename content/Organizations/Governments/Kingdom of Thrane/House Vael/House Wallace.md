## Overview

House Wallace is the ruling comital house of [[Timber County]] within the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]]. Though the family’s lineage in the region predates the [[War of the Fractured Crown]], its current prominence is inseparable from that conflict. House Wallace is known primarily for its martial tradition and its close identification with frontier defense, qualities that have defined both its reputation and its authority.

Before the war, House Wallace was a minor but respected noble line, tasked with overseeing Timber County’s eastern forests and maintaining security along the inland reaches of the [[Eldhollow Road]]. Their holdings were modest, their influence local, and their obligations clear. The war transformed this standing, elevating the house through visible service rather than political maneuvering.

During the War of the Fractured Crown, members of House Wallace distinguished themselves in royal service, particularly in engagements along Valorden’s northern approaches and in efforts to prevent the spread of unrest into Vaelwyth. Their conduct earned the Crown’s favor and reinforced the family’s role as defenders of the frontier. While House Wallace did not rise through formal elevation, its reputation emerged strengthened and widely recognized.
