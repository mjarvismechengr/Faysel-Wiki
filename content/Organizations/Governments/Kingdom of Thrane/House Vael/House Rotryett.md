## Overview

House Rotryett is the ruling comital house of [[Eldhollow County]] within the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]]. The Rotryetts are an established coastal and riverine noble family whose authority predates the [[House Rotryett]] by generations. Their power has never been defined by great military campaigns or courtly ambition, but by long stewardship of one of Thrane’s most important frontier trade corridors.

Before the war, House Rotryett was already firmly entrenched as Eldhollow’s administrative center, overseeing river traffic, customs enforcement, and the flow of goods along the Shepherd’s Highway. Their position at the mouth of the [[Eldhollow River]] placed them at the intersection of forest, coast, and kingdom, making them indispensable to both local stability and northern trade.

During the War of the Fractured Crown, House Rotryett did not distinguish itself through dramatic declarations or battlefield heroics. Instead, they maintained order, upheld royal law, and ensured that Eldhollow remained open and functional while unrest spread elsewhere. Their loyalty was quiet, procedural, and uninterrupted, a fact noted by both ducal and royal authorities in the war’s aftermath.
