## Overview

House Vael is the ruling house of the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]] and among the oldest continuously governing noble lines in the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. Unlike houses elevated by war or royal favor, the Vaels are native to the land they rule, their authority shaped over generations by the demands of frontier governance rather than court politics. Their power rests on endurance, territorial knowledge, and a long history of holding the forest line where Thrane meets the wild.

The Vaels have ruled Vaelwyth since its earliest incorporation into the kingdom, when the southern reaches of the Endor Forest were first claimed and settled. Over time, the house became synonymous with the duchy itself, serving not merely as administrators but as wardens charged with protecting Thrane’s northwestern border. Their legitimacy is inherited, reinforced by performance, and rarely questioned within their domain.

Under the current duke, [[Stenwulf Vael]], the house has reached the height of its political influence. Stenwulf’s conduct during the [[War of the Fractured Crown]] and his ability to maintain stability along Valorden’s northern edge elevated House Vael’s standing well beyond its traditional frontier role. While the war was fought elsewhere, the Vaels’ reliability ensured that it did not spread, cementing their reputation as indispensable to the Crown.

### Rule and Reputation

House Vael governs through presence and preparedness rather than reform or ideology. Their rule emphasizes territorial security, disciplined patrols, and swift response to threats emerging from forest or coast. Law in Vaelwyth is firm but practical, shaped by the realities of distance, danger, and limited margin for error. Noble authority under the Vaels is respected so long as it functions in service of the duchy’s safety.

Within Vaelwyth, House Vael is broadly trusted. Settlements measure ducal success not by ceremony or decree, but by whether roads remain open, borders hold, and villages endure. The house inspires loyalty through consistency and shared risk rather than affection. The Vaels are expected to stand where others would withdraw, and they are judged accordingly.

At court in [[Independence]], House Vael is regarded as powerful, restrained, and difficult to replace. The Crown relies on the house’s judgment and experience, particularly in matters involving frontier security and arcane influence tied to the duchy. While the Vaels do not dominate royal politics through rhetoric or alliance building, their influence is felt whenever stability is at stake.

### Heraldry and Colors

House Vael’s heraldry features a dark evergreen field bearing a silver stag standing alert, its head raised and antlers spread. The stag is rendered in a naturalistic style, emphasizing vigilance.

The green field reflects the Endor Forest and the land the house has guarded for generations, symbolizing endurance, continuity, and quiet strength. Silver denotes duty, clarity of purpose, and the expectation that authority must be exercised visibly and honorably. Together, the colors communicate a house rooted in place, defined by watchfulness, and sustained by long familiarity with danger.

Vaelwyth’s soldiers wear wear the King’s Pattern in white, trimmed in forest green. The stag of House Vael is commonly displayed on a small patch on the shoulder or tabard corner.
