## Overview

House Solmara is the royal house of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]] and the longest-ruling dynasty on the continent of [[Isomar]]. Its authority is founded on sustained legitimacy through law, oath, and visible accountability. From its earliest days, the house aligned itself with the teachings of [[Cyrus]], shaping a monarchy defined by obligation rather than entitlement.

This philosophy is embodied most clearly in [[King's Blessing]], the crown of Cyrus and one of the [[Relics of Sundering]]. Unlike other divine artifacts hidden away or lost to history, the crown has remained openly worn by Solmara monarchs for generations. Its presence is a declaration rather than a safeguard. The Solmaras rule in full view of both people and god, accepting that their authority is continuously measured rather than permanently granted.

The crown does not empower tyranny, conquest, or fear. Instead, it binds the ruler to clarity of judgment and the weight of consequence. In this way, House Solmara does not merely _possess_ a relic of divine law. It submits to one. The continued reign of the house is therefore seen not as proof of invincibility, but as evidence of endurance under scrutiny.

### Rule and Reputation

House Solmara governs Thrane as a legal monarchy rather than a personal one. Royal authority is exercised through courts, charters, and sworn institutions, with the Crown positioned as the final arbiter rather than the primary actor. 

Among the nobility, Solmara rule is respected but not universally loved. The house’s insistence on accountability has curtailed privileges that once went unchallenged, and its reforms have disrupted long-standing arrangements between crown and vassal. Support for the house often aligns with belief in centralized law, while opposition tends to come from families whose influence depended on ambiguity or exemption.

Among commoners and civic authorities, House Solmara enjoys broad legitimacy. The crown’s visibility, consistency, and willingness to bind itself publicly to law has fostered trust even during periods of hardship. While individual monarchs rise and fall in popularity, the house itself is widely viewed as the stabilizing constant of the realm.

At the international level, Solmara rule lends Thrane a reputation for predictability. Treaties, oaths, and borders enforced by the Crown are generally honored across generations, making Thrane a reliable if inflexible power.

### Heraldry and Colors

House Solmara’s heraldry bears a gold winged sword balances on its tip upon a blue and white field. 

All soldiers of Thrane wear the King’s Pattern in white trimmed with their Duchy's colors. All soldiers bear the symbol of [[House Solmara]] on their chest and their duchie's symbol somewhere else. As part of the royal army of Thrane, soldiers are trimmed in gold and have no other duchy symbols.
