## Overview

House Solmara is the royal house of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]] and the longest-ruling dynasty on the continent of [[Isomar]]. Its authority is founded on sustained legitimacy through law, oath, and visible accountability. From its earliest days, the house aligned itself with the teachings of [[Cyrus]], shaping a monarchy defined by obligation rather than entitlement.

This philosophy is embodied most clearly in [[King's Blessing]], the crown of Cyrus and one of the [[Relics of Sundering]]. Unlike other divine artifacts hidden away or lost to history, the crown has remained openly worn by Solmara monarchs for generations. Its presence is a declaration rather than a safeguard. The Solmaras rule in full view of both people and god, accepting that their authority is continuously measured rather than permanently granted.

The crown does not empower tyranny, conquest, or fear. Instead, it binds the ruler to clarity of judgment and the weight of consequence. In this way, House Solmara does not merely _possess_ a relic of divine law. It submits to one. The continued reign of the house is therefore seen not as proof of invincibility, but as evidence of endurance under scrutiny.

### Notable Members

- [[Lytharion Solmara]]  
    The current monarch of Thrane. Lytharion is a reform-minded ruler who believes law must be actively maintained rather than merely preserved. His reign stabilized the kingdom after decades of bureaucratic decay and noble excess, but his insistence on accountability has earned him powerful enemies. He rules openly beneath King’s Blessing and is keenly aware that its judgment reflects not only on himself, but on House Solmara as a whole.
    
- [[Elyssara Solmara]]
    Heir apparent and the most visible face of the kingdom to its common people. Elyssara is widely loved for her compassion, accessibility, and concern for civic welfare. While she reveres the law, she questions how rigidly it must be applied, a stance that inspires hope among reformers and unease among traditionalists. Many believe her eventual reign will define whether Thrane hardens or softens in the generations to come.
    
- [[Dareth Solmara]]  
    Father of Lytharion and a pivotal figure in Solmara history. His peaceful but passive rule allowed corruption and factionalism to take root across Thrane’s institutions. Within the house, his reign is remembered not with hatred, but as a warning: legitimacy can erode quietly if left unexamined.
