## Overview

The Seabrook Town Council is the governing body of the coastal town of [[Seabrook]], responsible for civil law, local defense, taxation, and the daily administration of town affairs. It is composed of five councilors drawn from the town’s most influential residents, reflecting Seabrook’s long tradition of pragmatic self rule. 

The council meets regularly in [[Council Hall (Seabrook)]], where matters ranging from harbor fees and fishing rights to militia readiness and foreign delegations are debated and decided. Its power lies less in formal hierarchy and more in consensus building, reputation, and leverage. Decisions are often shaped as much by personal relationships and economic pressure as by open votes, a reality well understood by the town’s residents.

The current council represents a balance of Seabrook’s competing interests. Longstanding locals sit alongside newer arrivals, and military discipline, mercantile wealth, industrial ambition, and traditional fishing livelihoods all have voices at the table. This diversity is both the council’s strength and its weakness. It allows Seabrook to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, but it also makes the body vulnerable to deadlock, quiet deals, and competing agendas. Its current members are [[Eliander Fireborn]], [[Eda Oweland]], [[Anders Solmor]], [[Manistrad Copperlocks]], and [[Gellan Primewater]].
