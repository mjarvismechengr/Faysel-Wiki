## Overview

The Dramsfjord Enclave is one of the many autonomous tribes that form the broader cultural sphere of the [[Dimaheim Horde]]. Nestled deep within the Dramsvol Fjord, far from the open sea and protected by the dense [[Trollskog Forest]] and the looming rise of the [[Jotunspire Peaks]], the Enclave occupies a defensible and secluded stretch of land centered around the settlement of [[Arvidsjaur]].

Unlike the coastal clans that prize longships and raiding, or the highland tribes that define themselves through roaming conquest, the Dramsfjord Enclave is inward facing and territorial. Its people are woodsfolk, hunters, and ironworkers who rely on the fjord’s fisheries, the surrounding forests, and the mineral wealth of the nearby mountains. The geography of the fjord itself shapes their identity. With its narrow mouth and winding interior waters, Dramsvol can be defended by a relatively small force, allowing the Enclave to avoid some of the instability that marks other Dimaheim territories.

Governance within the Enclave is distinctive. Rather than a single chieftain, the tribe is ruled by a council of three matriarchs, elder half orc women whose authority rests on age and memory. The council operates by consensus when possible, with the Head Matriarch serving as tie breaker when agreement cannot be reached. Currently, the head matriarch is [[Ghorza Kuisma]], with [[Olga Kokko]], and [[Bulak Tanck]] being the other two members of the council. 

The Enclave participates in the greater movements of the Horde during times of war, sending warriors and honoring alliances with neighboring tribes. Yet its devotion to the war god [[Rodikar]] is more tempered than that of many Dimaheim clans. Worship is common and culturally embedded, but less fervent. Ritual combat and blood rites exist, though they are not the sole measure of worth within the community.

Arvidsjaur itself reflects this balance. It is fortified but not ostentatious, practical rather than grand. Timber longhouses sit beneath towering pines, and stonework drawn from the mountains reinforces key structures. The settlement lies far enough into the fjord to feel removed from the outside world, yet close enough to the sea to answer the call of war when required.

Within Dimaheim, the Dramsfjord Enclave is regarded as steady and self contained. It does not produce the most famous champions nor the most fearsome raiders, yet it stands. In a land where survival is victory, that reputation carries its own quiet strength.
