## Overview

The [[Dimaheim Horde]] is not a nation in the traditional sense, but a vast cultural sphere of fiercely independent warrior tribes that surround the Jotunspire Peaks on the continent of Dimaheim. Orcish, human, half-orc, and mixed-bloodline peoples live side by side, bound not by law or crown, but by shared traditions of war, kinship, and reverence for strength.

The tribes do not acknowledge a king, council, or unified government. Each clan rules itself according to ancestral custom, answering only to its own chieftains, shamans, and champions. When faced with existential threats or holy war, these tribes may temporarily unite under a single war leader, forming what outsiders call the Horde.

At the eastern edge of [[Dimaheim]] stands [[Grenevik]], the only true city in the region. Part trade hub, part proving ground, and part sacred gathering place, Grenevik serves as the symbolic heart of Dimaheim culture despite belonging fully to no single tribe.

For generations, the Dimaheim Horde has been locked in near-constant conflict with the [[Shimazu Shogunate]] of [[Yoseju]]. Their struggle centers on a contested island between the two powers, home to [[Mt. Mertari]] a site held sacred by both cultures and claimed as the birthplace of the war-god [[Rodikar]].

To the outside world, Dimaheim is feared for its raiders, mercenaries, and brutal champions. Within its borders, however, lies a deeply spiritual society shaped by ancient rites and blood-bound traditions.

## Culture

Life in Dimaheim is defined by hardship and deliberate endurance. From childhood, individuals are taught that conflict is not a failing of the world but its natural state, and that greatness is earned only through trial. Strength is respected not merely as physical power, but as the will to endure pain, loss, and challenge without breaking.

Tribal identity is paramount. One’s clan defines lineage, honor, and obligation, and betrayal of the tribe is considered the gravest of sins. Alliances between tribes are fluid, often shaped by marriages, shared victories, or ancestral grudges that stretch back centuries.

Unlike the rigid codes of Yoseju, Dimaheim culture embraces the dual nature of war. Tactical brilliance is admired, but so too is ferocity and raw courage. A clever ambush and a savage charge are equally worthy if they lead to victory.

Daily life varies widely across the region. Some tribes roam as semi-nomadic hunters across tundra and highland, while others maintain fortified halls along fjords or mountain passes. Coastal clans command longships and prize navigation and raiding, while inland tribes are renowned smiths and rune-carvers, crafting weapons meant to last generations.

Raiding is simply a means of survival and a recognized expression of strength. Captives taken in war may be absorbed into a tribe, put to labor, or enslaved without moral stigma, their fate determined by the customs of the victors.

Magic among the Horde is rare and deeply spiritual. It is practiced primarily by shamans who commune with ancestral spirits, the land itself, and the echoes of blood spilled in battle. Runes, trance-rituals, and blood offerings are common expressions of this magic. Blood magic is not feared in Dimaheim. It is revered as sacred.

Dimaheim culture is rooted in martial pride, tribal loyalty, and a reverence for struggle as the crucible of greatness. Unlike the people of Yoseju’s strict codes of honor, Dimaheim embraces the dual nature of war, both the tactical brilliance and the savage chaos.

### Faith and the War-God

The spiritual heart of the Dimaheim Horde is [[Rodikar]], once mortal and now divine. According to Dimaheimer belief, Rodikar was the first child born after [[The Sundering]] introduced mortality to the world. Through relentless struggle, he rose from raider to champion, from general to conqueror, and ultimately to godhood.

Worship of Rodikar is not expressed through sermons. It is demonstrated through action. Duels, feats of endurance, ritual bloodletting, and acts of battlefield leadership are considered prayers in motion. To fight well is to honor him. To grow complacent is to invite his scorn.

Legends speak of Rodikar’s valkyries, divine war spirits who claim the souls of worthy warriors slain in battle. The first of these spirits is said to have fallen upon [[Mt. Mertari]], giving the mountain its name, translated by some as “The Dead Angel’s Peak.”

## History

### The Holy War with Yoseju

Conflict between Dimaheim and Yoseju has been ongoing for generations. Both cultures have contested the island between them and the sacred mountain that rises at its center. Raids, invasions, and counter-invasions have never fully ceased, even during brief lulls in open warfare.

Both sides believe the struggle to be spiritually necessary. To the people of Dimaheim, the war is a crucible meant to temper the strong and destroy the weak. To the Shimazu Shogunate, it is a test of discipline, order, and rightful mastery of the blade.

At the center of the conflict lies an ancient prophecy shared, though interpreted differently, by both peoples:

> _“When the Red Peak bleeds,  
> the Chosen of Rodikar  
> shall take the Sanguine Throne,  
> and the War-God shall return.”_

Each culture believes control of Mt. Mertari will determine the meaning and outcome of this prophecy, ensuring that the war, for now, has no end.
