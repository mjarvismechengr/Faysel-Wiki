## Overview

Sanbalet’s Gang is a small smuggling ring based in the [[Alchemist's House]] that operates along the [[Siren Coast]]. Unlike larger criminal syndicates with formal hierarchies or international reach, the gang functions as a tightly controlled outfit centered almost entirely around the leadership of [[Sanbalet]]. Its structure is practical and transactional, built for discretion rather than spectacle.

The group’s activities have primarily involved the covert movement of weapons, armor, and restricted materials through hidden coastal routes and temporary safehouses. By exploiting [[Seabrook]]’s position as a working port town with divided political loyalties, the gang has been able to move goods without drawing sustained attention from local authorities. Their operations rely on timing, secrecy, and knowledge of shoreline geography more than brute force.

The gang’s scale has remained modest, particularly when compared to more established criminal organizations elsewhere on the continent. Its influence is localized, and its stability depends heavily on the competence and caution of its leader. Without him, it would likely fragment rather than endure.
