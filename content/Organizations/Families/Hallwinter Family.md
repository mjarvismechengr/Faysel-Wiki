## Overview

The Hallwinter Family was once a minor noble house of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]], known for producing disciplined knights sworn to crown and oath alike. Though never among the most powerful houses, the Hallwinters built a reputation on reliability. Their banners were present in border skirmishes, royal escorts, and regional disputes, and their name became quietly associated with integrity in service.

Culturally, the family embodied a traditional Thranish ideal of knighthood rooted in loyalty, restraint, and spoken oath. Their devotion aligned closely with the teachings of [[Cyrus]], particularly the sanctity of vows and the moral weight of silence when justice demanded speech. They were not a religious house in a formal sense, but their identity was inseparable from lawful service and the visible performance of duty.

The family line has since collapsed, its estates dissolved and its name largely absent from current Thranish politics. The key once hidden within their crypt was removed by a cult cell operating in [[Oldport]], bringing an end to the Hallwinters’ final custodial duty. What remains of the house survives only in records, ruined stone, and the memory of a lineage that once held silence as sacred responsibility rather than convenience.
