## History

Dotrice was born in [[Bromjinar]], a small village where everyone knew one another and nothing stayed secret for long. From an early age, he thrived in that closeness. He liked knowing what people were doing, where they were going, and why. Stories found him easily, and he learned just as quickly how to pass them on. Sometimes that made him a storyteller. Sometimes a gossip. Often both.

As he grew older, words alone were no longer enough. Dotrice discovered music and began shaping the stories he heard into song, finding that melody could carry memory farther than speech ever could. He fell deeply in love with the works of [[Cosham]], the famed bard whose songs told of a doomed band of heroes slain in the [[battle of Quoridon]]. Their stories lingered with Dotrice, not as tragedy, but as proof that being remembered mattered.

Dotrice was raised by his parents, [[Beckett]], a farmer, and [[Tes]], a seamstress. They gave him a steady, supportive home and never discouraged his wandering curiosity. His younger brother, [[Wally]], works aboard a fishing vessel, and the family remains close-knit despite the distance that work and ambition sometimes create.

In preparation for a larger life, Dotrice spent much of his time in the [[Salty Seaman]]. He worked as a barkeep, listened more than he spoke, and sharpened his instincts for people as much as for performance. He befriended [[Loz]], the goliath town guard and tavern bouncer, whose talent for fighting contrasted sharply with Dotrice’s talent for words. The tavern’s owner, [[Pop]], had studied magic in his youth and quietly passed on what knowledge he could, encouraging Dotrice’s curiosity without demanding a path.

Eventually, the stories of others were no longer enough. Dotrice felt the pull to become part of a tale rather than merely its teller. When the chance came to leave Bromjinar and join an eclectic crew of adventurers, he took it without hesitation.
