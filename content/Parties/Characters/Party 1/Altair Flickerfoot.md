## History

Altair was raised in the [[Twilight Glade]], a secluded elven enclave hidden deep within the [[Endor Forest]]. The glade was a place of balance and quiet reverence, known for its celestial observatories and its devotion to twilight worship. From an early age, Altair was drawn to the stars. Many nights were spent beside his father, [[Sorin Flickerfoot]], stargazing from [[Luminara Spire]], the spiritual heart of the glade. Those evenings shaped Altair’s sense of wonder and planted the belief that the heavens were not distant lights, but guides.

Sorin’s sudden death shattered that certainty. He fell to an unknown sickness contracted while exploring the ancient [[Ruins of Mirskwa]], leaving behind questions with no answers. The loss weighed heavily on Altair and ignited a deeper hunger to understand the forces that governed fate, death, and the cosmos. In the years that followed, [[Orion Starwatcher]] took on the role of mentor, guiding Altair’s spiritual growth and teaching them to listen for meaning in silence, shadow, and starlight.

Despite the glade’s serenity, Altair often felt divided. The enclave’s modern, inward-looking philosophy clashed with their yearning for something greater and more distant. Their mother, [[Sylvaris Flickerfoot]], grew cold and reserved after Sorin’s passing, though Altair remained close to their sister, [[Calyn Flickerfoot]], whose presence anchored them to home.

Everything changed during a twilight meditation beneath a cloudless sky. The stars shifted and aligned, forming the silhouette of Seabrook’s coastal cliffs wrapped in dusk. The vision carried certainty rather than explanation. Something awaited there, a celestial relic bound to the balance between light and shadow.

Altair took this as a calling. Leaving the Twilight Glade, they began a pilgrimage toward Seabrook, offering healing and guidance along the roads and watching the night sky for further signs. Upon arrival, whispers of an abandoned alchemist’s house reached them. Stories spoke of hidden wealth, hauntings, and lingering darkness. Altair recognized the place immediately as the destination shown in the stars.

While investigating the house, Altair encountered smugglers moving enchanted contraband. Fascinated by the unnatural glow of their crates, Altair lingered too long. The smugglers seized them, either mistaking them for a spy or unwilling to risk a witness. Altair was imprisoned in the house’s basement, left alone in darkness and silence.

Rather than despair, Altair interpreted this as purpose. If the stars had led them here, then this confinement was not failure, but trial. A test of faith, patience, and resolve set by the heavens themselves.

Altair walks the world as a devoted follower of [[Castor]], trusting that the stars do not mislead, only withhold their meaning until the seeker is ready.
