## History

Rex was born in a kobold colony nestled in the [[Iron Hills]] just outside [[Meliard]]. His earliest memories are shaped less by place than by motion. Camps rose and fell, tunnels opened and closed, and the world was always something being worked on rather than lived in.

He remembers little of his mother, [[Gwen]], beyond her smile and a sense of warmth that lingered even after she was gone. His father, [[Glick]], rarely spoke of her, but he never lacked affection. Glick became Rex’s teacher, companion, and anchor. Together they traveled with the [[Iron Hills Mining Co.]], moving from site to site as work demanded. Where others saw labor, Rex saw opportunity. His father taught him patience, careful hands, and the joy of building something useful.

They spent long evenings crafting small inventions meant to make life easier or simply more amusing. Self-stirring spoons. Automatic striking stones. Pop-up shelters cobbled together from scrap and cleverness. Glick showed him that there was magic beyond spells, a quiet wonder in shaping the world with tools and intention. He taught Rex that invention was a form of hope.

During these travels, Rex befriended a young dwarf named [[Bigsby Firebrand]], the son of a fellow miner. The two shared a fascination with mechanisms and stonework, but the road eventually carried them apart. Rex has not seen Bigsby since.

Rex grew up listening to stories of ancient ages when technology and magic were intertwined, when inventors reshaped the world before it fell into its current state. Glick spoke often of legendary figures, none more vivid than [[Grebambit Bafflebob|Greg the Creator]], whose enchanted tools could coax life from inanimate things. These tales took root in Rex’s mind. He did not turn to temples for meaning. He looked backward, searching the past for ideas worth carrying forward.

When Rex came of age, he joined the mining company in earnest, working alongside his father. Though the work was often mundane, he delighted in discovery. Unusual stones, geodes, sapphires, and strange fragments caught his eye, and he quietly built a personal collection of curiosities. The other kobolds resented the mines. To Rex, the tunnels were classrooms.

On one assignment outside [[Y'varius]], Rex passed near the [[Ruins of Mirskwa]]. The sight of them stirred something deep and unresolved, a reminder that the world still held forgotten knowledge waiting to be reclaimed.

That sense of wonder was shattered when [[Glick]] was killed in a mine collapse. Whispers spread quickly. Some blamed faulty equipment. Others blamed Rex. Whether through negligence or misfortune, the weight of accusation settled heavily on him. Grief became tangled with guilt, and the colony that had once felt like home grew hostile.

His wandering eventually led him to [[Seabrook]], a place rough around the edges but full of movement and possibility. There, he found others willing to risk themselves on uncertain paths. Rex hopes that through adventure, invention, and discovery, he can prove his worth, honor his father’s belief in him, and perhaps rediscover the kind of magic that once changed the world.
