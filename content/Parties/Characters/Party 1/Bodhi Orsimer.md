## History

Bodhi does not know where he was born.

His earliest memories begin in the [[Dramsfjord Enclave]], surrounded by high fjord walls, whipping wind, and voices that felt like family.

---

Bodhi was raised by [[Ghorza Kuisma]], [[Bulak Tanck]], and [[Olga Kokko]] within the Dramsfjord Enclave. They gave him a steady upbringing and a sense of belonging rooted in strength, endurance, and shared labor. He views the enclave not as fosterage, but as family. Whatever he lacks in answers about his birth, he gained in purpose among them.  

When Bodhi reached adulthood, he followed the expected path. He left his home in [[Arvidsjaur]] and joined the [[Dimaheim Horde]] as a soldier, as generations before him had done. War was not unfamiliar to him. It felt almost natural. That familiarity did not save him. During the horde’s attack on [[Mokodoya]], Bodhi and several others were captured. They were sold to fire giants and dragged far away and stripped of their freedom.

Bodhi was forced to fight as a gladiator in the [[Bloodlust Arena]]. For a year he survived beneath the burning gaze of the crowds. Under the tutelage of [[Decimus Ogmarr]], his skill sharpened into something ruthless and precise. Pain became instruction. Survival became instinct.  

When Decimus led a slave revolt, Bodhi followed without hesitation. During the fighting, Bodhi came upon a finely crafted, rune-covered helm, abandoned. He took it without ceremony.
