## History

Lucian was born in [[Palindrar]], within the radiant city known as the [[Palindrar|Promise of Light]]. He was raised as an only child by his parents, [[Endrar|Endrar the Bold]] and [[Cynthliria|Cynthliria the Fair]], and from his earliest days was immersed in the worship of [[Solara]], as tradition demanded. Faith, discipline, and obedience shaped the lives of Palindrar’s children, but Lucian was never content with certainty alone. He questioned the assumptions of his peers and found little comfort in doctrine that discouraged curiosity.

His mentor, [[Padmaja]], recognized this restlessness and encouraged him to seek understanding beyond repetition. Lucian turned to study with fervor, pouring himself into forgotten texts and neglected corners of the city’s archives. It was there that he discovered the rune. Dark, alien, and profoundly out of place, it bore no resemblance to Solaran scripture or known magical forms. Drawn to it despite himself, Lucian attempted to channel its power. The rune responded by burning itself into his hand, becoming a permanent mark.

In time, the rune granted him power. Shadow answered where light had once sufficed. Yet the gift carried a cost. His eyes darkened. His presence unsettled others. Whispers followed him through the city’s halls. Though Padmaja stood by him, the council of Palindrar did not. Lucian was exiled, declared a danger to the sanctity of the Promise of Light.

His parents could not bear the shame. Alongside his exile came disavowal. Lucian left Palindrar alone, stripped of name, place, and certainty.

He wandered far from the city of his birth, crossing the [[Gold Grass Prairie]] and passing through the [[Goldwood]], following rumors and half-truths wherever they led. He listened for mention of runes, forbidden magic, or powers that did not fit neatly into the world’s accepted order. Eventually, his travels carried him to the coast, where he built a quiet life near the [[Endor Forest]].

Lucian’s cabin lies not far from [[Seabrook]], and he is a frequent presence at the [[Empty Net]]. He listens more than he speaks, attentive to dark rumors and whispered stories that might shed light on the mark bound to his hand. When word reached him of strange lore and lingering secrets within an [[Alchemist's House]] up the coast, Lucian recognized the pull immediately.
