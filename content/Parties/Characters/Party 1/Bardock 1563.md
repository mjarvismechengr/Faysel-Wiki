## History

Bardock remembers nothing of his life before awakening. There are no dreams of childhood, no faces, no names, no sense of origin. His earliest memory is awareness returning slowly, like breath after drowning. Weight. Cold earth. The sound of rain somewhere above him. Why he woke remains a mystery even to himself.

---

A recent storm loosened the hill that held their remains. A minor mudslide tore the earth open and carried Bardock and the shattered bodies of his companions down into the forest below. He lay dormant for weeks before the spark returned.
 
When Bardock finally rose, alone and disoriented, he followed the only instinct that felt natural. He walked. That road led him to [[Bromjinar]], where he took a seat in the [[Salty Seaman]]. There, [[Pop]] and [[Dotrice]] showed him a kindness he did not expect and could not explain. They spoke to him as if he were a person rather than a thing. Bardock came to care for them quickly, fiercely.

When Dotrice spoke of leaving to go adventuring, Bardock did not hesitate. If his past was lost, then his future was something he could choose. Staying behind was never an option.
