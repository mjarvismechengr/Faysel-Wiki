## Overview

A long-abandoned [[Alchemist's House]] overlooking the cliffs near [[Seabrook]] had become the subject of local rumor. Tales of hauntings, hidden wealth, and forbidden knowledge drew the newly formed party together, each member following their own motivations. What appeared to be a simple investigation quickly revealed something more deliberate.

Beneath the house, the party uncovered a covert smuggling operation led by the mage [[Sanbalet]]. Rather than destroying the ring outright, the party chose negotiation over bloodshed. Sanbalet was spared in exchange for information and the promise of future cooperation, leaving the smuggling network damaged but not eradicated.

Through this discovery, the party learned of a larger operation tied to the ship [[The Sea Ghost]], commanded by [[Captain Sigurd|Sigurd Snake Eyes]]. The existence of the vessel confirmed that the Alchemist’s House was only one piece of a broader criminal enterprise operating along the coast.

The events at the house marked the party’s first real entanglement with forces moving beneath Seabrook’s surface. Gold, secrets, and leverage were gained, but more importantly, the group established a pattern that would define them going forward. They are not merely hunters of monsters or seekers of coin. They are willing to bargain with dangerous people if it serves a greater purpose.

Clues recovered during the investigation hinted at darker currents moving through the region, foreshadowing threats far beyond simple smuggling and tying the affair into the wider fate of Faysel.
