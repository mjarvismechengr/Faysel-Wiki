## Overview

For generations, [[Widow's Light]] stood watch over Oldport, believed by some to be more than a lighthouse. Members of [[The Tideborn Pact]] held that its beacon functioned as a ward, a binding mechanism meant to hold something ancient and malignant beneath the marsh and sea.

In the days leading up to the party’s arrival, the lighthouse’s light began to falter. Its keeper, [[Jonas Greaves]], grew erratic and withdrawn, and fishermen reported strange disturbances offshore during moments when the beacon dimmed. Rumors spread that something beneath Oldport was stirring.

Before leaving the city, the party chose to investigate the lighthouse themselves. Inside Widow’s Light, they found signs of failing wards and ancient runic work tied directly to the beacon’s function. Beneath the tower lay a sealed trapdoor leading downward, which Jonas refused to open. The party came close to breaching it, but ultimately chose another path.

Reaching the upper structure, the party repaired the lighthouse mechanism and reinforced the failing runes woven into the beacon itself. As the light was restored to full strength, the oppressive unease surrounding the tower lifted. The disturbances in the water subsided, and whatever lay beneath was forced back into dormancy.

In the aftermath, Jonas Greaves appeared markedly changed. The paranoia and agitation that had plagued him faded, replaced by exhaustion and quiet clarity. He offered little explanation, but it was clear that the lighthouse had been doing far more than guiding ships.
