## Overview

The [[Mariners' Guild]] sought to claim [[Abbey Isle]] as a strategic lighthouse site, but repeated landing attempts had failed due to undead defenses along the island’s only safe approach. In the same window of opportunity, [[Sanbalet]] approached the party with a private offer. His buyers on the island had gone silent after smoke was seen rising from the ruins, and he wanted confirmation of their status. He promised a finder’s fee and allowed the party to keep whatever they recovered.

The party chose to take Sanbalet’s job and sailed aboard [[The Sea Ghost]] under [[Captain Sigurd|Sigurd Snake Eyes]]. Reaching the island, they pushed through trapped dunes and undead guardians to the burned abbey ruins, where a small number of surviving cultists emerged. The party initially de-escalated by presenting themselves as Sanbalet’s associates and spoke with [[Ozymandias]], the group’s leader. The cultists’ cloaks matched those seen in [[Oldport]]’s Daghor cult activity, tying the island cell to wider threats.

During the return toward the beach, internal fracture among the survivors surfaced. [[Odium]] attempted to bargain for his own survival by offering betrayal and guidance in exchange for killing Ozymandias. The party turned on the survivors instead, ambushing Ozymandias and his guards. The guards were killed, Ozymandias was taken alive, and the party recovered a cult amulet marked with an emaciated hand and an eye. Odium was later killed as well.

The party forced their way into the cellars beneath the abbey, crushing resistance and ultimately subduing the remaining survivors. [[Bayleaf]] became the turning point. Under a zone of truth, he claimed he was a mercenary hired to train guards, not a believer. He guided the party through the cellar complex, where they recovered occult materials and identified texts including the [[Skies of Sulfur]] series. Bayleaf also revealed a hidden access into the Winding Way, a concealed vault beneath the abbey.

Inside the Winding Way, the party encountered undead guardians and lethal traps. Ozymandias entered first and died almost immediately, seemingly overwhelmed by fear or a warded terror within. The party pressed on, overcame a sequence of trials, exposed an illusory treasure chamber, pacified a stone guardian using Ozymandias’s amulet, and discovered the true treasure room beyond. They looted what they could and withdrew to the surface.

On departure, the party deceived the smugglers. They provided [[Captain Sigurd]] a safe route through the dunes and convinced him the cultists were dead, paying the crew off with a gold bar to keep things smooth. Returning to [[Seabrook]], they reported to [[Sanbalet]], who thanked them, paid what he owed, and offered future work.

Abbey Isle was left cleared of its immediate threats and stripped of its hidden wealth, but its deeper significance remained. The party had now directly dismantled a Daghor-linked cell, recovered cult objects and texts, and gained further leverage within Seabrook’s shadow economy.
