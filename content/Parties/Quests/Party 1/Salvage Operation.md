## Overview
### Summary
_Salvage Operation_ starts as an investigation adventure, in which the characters board _Emperor of the Waves_ and explore its upper decks. As they venture into the ship’s lower decks, this scenario becomes more of a dungeon crawl in cramped, dangerous spaces, with vermin attacking in close quarters. Characters who survive those threats and push on find the lowest holds flooded with seawater and infested with undead.

As the characters fight their way forward in search of Aubreck’s goal, the perils of the sea finally take their delayed claim on the _Emperor_, in the form of a hungry elder octopus. This creature first assaulted the ship several days before the characters arrive. Its previous rampage failed to scuttle the ship, though the octopus succeeded in devouring or drowning almost all of its living occupants.

To say that the _Emperor_ now has a skeleton crew would be an overstatement. Of all the cultists who escaped the island, only a single evil druid remains alive aboard ship. The half-orc [Krell Grohlg](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/319295-krell-grohlg) still practices his worship of Lolth at a shrine inside the ship and is aided in his defense of the vessel by various kinds of spiders, swarms of vermin, and other monstrosities.

The climax of the adventure is a race against time as the octopus returns for a final onslaught, with decks flooding, the ship sinking, and characters scrambling through the disintegrating hull in a race for their lives. If Krell or his minions are still alive, they present an additional obstacle because they also don’t want to go down with the ship.

In order for the characters to receive their payment from Aubreck, they must bring back a heavy box from the cargo hold — potentially forcing them to choose between making a quick escape and accomplishing their mission.

### Storyline
The merchant prince Aubreck Drallion once counted himself among the richest folk of his city. His trade fleet was one of the largest and most prosperous of its kind, with hundreds of ships under his banner dodging storms, pirate raids, and aquatic monsters to carry goods across the world.

Yet Aubreck’s success perhaps came too fast and too easily; although his profits eventually stabilized, his ambition kept expanding. Years ago, his contacts in the southern jungles reported that he could monopolize trade in rare spices and herbs by making heavy investments in the area. Aubreck took the opportunity as a sure thing and leaped at the chance to get even richer. He sold off many of his assets and converted the proceeds to property deeds and promissory notes, then secured that portable wealth aboard _Emperor of the Waves_, the foremost ship in his fleet.

Aubreck’s plan was to convert these notes back into cash when the ship reached its destination in the south, but fate introduced a cruel twist, and _Emperor of the Waves_ disappeared. A storm separated the ship from its escort, and it was never heard from again. Devastated by the financial loss, Aubreck was reduced to the lifestyle of an ordinary merchant.

The true fate of _Emperor of the Waves_ is known only to a few. The ship was nearly sunk in the storm that drove it off course, but it remained seaworthy. After the storm subsided, its surviving crew members dropped anchor near an uncharted island. When they came ashore to look for food and water, they discovered the island was inhabited by tribes of primitive humans, orcs, and goblins, ruled by cruel druids who worshiped Lolth in her aspect as the Queen of Spiders. The druids promptly had the few remaining sailors dispatched by their underlings and claimed the ship as a sign of favor from their dark goddess.

In time, the island’s population became fractured into two factions, each of which tried to exterminate the other. One group claimed custody of the ship and used it as a headquarters, stocking it with supplies and defending it from assaults by the enemy group. When the war entered its final throes, the ship was in danger of bring overrun by the land-based forces. In response, rather than staying and fighting it out, the cultists aboard the ship pulled up anchor — and thanks to an offshore wind, they rode the waves and left the island far behind.

Fifteen days ago, Aubreck received word that _Emperor of the Waves_ had been spotted adrift in the southern sea, apparently a ghost ship. The noble promptly used a sizable chunk of his savings to hire a ship and crew to sail to the derelict. Aubreck believes he can restore his standing if he recovers the deeds and documents that sailed with the ship. Now, all he needs are a few brave souls able to deal with whatever threats might present themselves aboard the _Emperor_ and bring back his fortune.

### Inciting Action
The Milkmen are approached by a wiry half-orc named [[Vertheg]] on behalf of his employer [[Aubreck Drallion]]. Aubreck explains that the ship holds a magic box containing promissory notes and property deeds worth a total of 100,000 gp. He offers the characters a fee of 10 percent (10,000 gp) to recover it. As a gesture of good faith, he offers them an advance payment of 200 gp. (Even if they try their best but still fail to recover the box, Aubreck cannot afford to pay them anything more.) He says that the ship was recently spotted adrift, approximately five days out from land.

The noble is worried that someone else might claim the ship’s goods as salvage if he doesn’t act quickly. He has already hired a ship, _Soul of Winter_, and a crew to mount a mission to the derelict. Now he needs adventurers to go along and board the _Emperor_ once they reach it, then find the box and bring it back.

Aubreck describes the box as made of shiny blue metal. It is packed inside a wooden crate branded with a large letter _A_. The crate can easily be pried or broken open, but the box can’t be opened except with a password known only to Aubreck. It contains all of Aubreck’s deeds and promissory notes, still sealed in waterproof wrappings. The notes are drawn from a lawful good temple that will pay them out only after the original owner of the assets gives permission, and their value will enable Aubreck to rebuild his business once he redeems them for himself.

### Resolution
If the characters return Aubreck’s box to him, the merchant is overjoyed. By redeeming the deeds and notes, he can reestablish himself in his city. He pays the characters the promised fee of 12,000 gp along with a [ring of spell storing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4730-ring-of-spell-storing) and gladly replaces any mundane items they lost in the adventure.

In point of fact, the box is not impenetrable, but it is sealed with extremely powerful magic, requiring a successful DC 30 check to overcome with [dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2072-dispel-magic). It can also be opened by speaking the password “Tildivarias,” the name of Aubreck’s dog from his childhood. (Aubreck does not share this information with anyone.)

Aubreck could become a well-connected ally, and a continuing source of adventure for the party, if his fortune is restored — that is, if he doesn’t become too greedy and eventually betray the characters. 

> Waiting near the docks with a smile, is Vertheg, the familiar faced half-orc whose fine dress starkly contrasts that of the dockworkers who surround him. As you approach he greets you warmly, "Master Aubreck has been eagerly awaiting your arrival. Let's get his box loaded and brought to the house, he'd like to conclude the deal as soon as possible."
> 
> Vertheg gestures to a waiting wagon—a sturdy, sea-worn thing with cracked blue paint and mismatched wheels, drawn by a patient-looking draft horse with a single milky eye. Once you board, the wagon rumbles through Seabrook’s winding streets, slick with rain and humming with the quiet activity of late-day labor. You pass rows of moss-flecked buildings pressed shoulder to shoulder—each etched with generations of weather and salt. Candles flicker behind warped glass panes. A weaver shutters her stall, a pair of urchins chase each other through an alley, and an old man nods off behind a barrow of bruised apples.
> 
> As you climb a narrow lane flanked by leaning cedar fences and drooping laundry lines, the bustle fades behind you. Trees reclaim the space here—ferns poke through cobblestones, and rain drips steadily from overgrown eaves. Eventually the road curves upward, leading you to a broad clearing at the edge of town, where the forest gives way to a low stone wall and an iron gate hanging slightly ajar. Beyond it stands Drallion mansion.
> 
> At first glance, it’s impressive—a stately three-story home of weathered limestone and dark slate roofs, with broad windows and carved balconies that once promised wealth and grace. But time has not been kind. Several shutters hang askew, and the paint on the trim has all but peeled away.
> 
> Yet beneath the neglect, the bones of the house remain noble. There’s grandeur in its height, symmetry in its design, and a sense that it once commanded attention—a mansion built to impress merchants, rivals, and foreign dignitaries alike. From its high perch, you can just make out the roofs of Seabrook below and, beyond them, the glint of the sea.
> 
> Vertheg hops down with a grunt and opens the gate. “Home sweet home,” he says dryly. “Master Aubreck’s in the study. He’s… in good spirits today.”
> 
> Inside, the air is thick with the scent of old wood, damp parchment, and cold fireplace ash. A grand staircase curves upward to a shadowed second floor, its balustrade draped in cobwebs. Vertheg leads you deeper into the mansion, past shut doors and unused halls where your footsteps echo strangely. Somewhere, water drips. Somewhere else, floorboards creak with no one on them. At last, he opens a heavy door into a study that smells faintly of brandy and lemon oil. Within you see Aubreck sitting behind a desk. 
> 
> “Welcome to my home—or what remains of it. You’ve come a long way, and I’m grateful to see you’ve returned in one piece. Seabrook’s changed, and not all for the better… but some things, at least, remain dependable." He gestures to the chest you brought. “My property. At long last. Let’s see this chapter closed.” After inspecting it and nodding to Vertheg to bring it inside, he turns back to the party.
> 
> “You've given me a chance to reclaim my former life, and I won't waste it. You’ve done what others failed to do, or feared to try. That earns my trust… and my generosity. I may not command the fleets I once did, but with what I _do_ still have, I’d like to express my gratitude even beyond our original arrangement. I'm leaving Seabrook for [[Kalakoayan]] tomorrow, and I don't imagine I'll return. I don’t currently have the time or funds to restore my home to its former glory, and seeing as I won't be around, I don't need it. But If you’re staying in Seabrook… I'd like you to have it.”
> 
> Aubreck pulls your payment of 12,000 gp and [Ring of Spell Storing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4730-ring-of-spell-storing) from behind his desk along with a freshly signed deed. "All I need is your signature."

### Arrival
After several days at sea, _Soul of Winter_ comes in sight of the looming, shattered hulk of the derelict _Emperor of the Waves_. Wolgar Windrune brings _Soul of Winter_ within 500 feet of the derelict along its starboard side, close enough to make out its major external features. Its masts have been shorn off, but the upper deck appears clear of debris, as if whatever hit the ship was strong enough to carry off the masts, sails, and rigging. Its figurehead, once a majestic angel in flight, has been hacked and disfigured.

Captain Wolgar and the sailors aboard _Soul of Winter_ express amazement that the _Emperor_ is still afloat. Any character who has the sailor background or proficiency with water vehicles notes that the ship has suffered heavy damage across its upper decks, consistent with the effect of a typhoon or tidal wave. The vessel lists noticeably to port, evidence that the _Emperor_’s ballast has shifted, though the incline doesn’t appear severe enough to make moving around on deck hazardous. The ship rides low in the water, implying that the bilge and possibly even the lowest deck are flooded. If no characters have the appropriate background or proficiency, Wolgar can point these facts out. The captain also makes it clear that he suspects the ship is likely to sink during the ten days it would take to tow it back to port.

Not all of the ship’s visible damage is due to time and weather. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check, a character can spot impact damage to the ship’s hull that indicates it recently came under attack from a seagoing creature.

The captain orders two sailors to ferry the characters to the _Emperor_ in a [rowboat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/vehicles/rowboat). The sailors bring ropes and grappling hooks to give the characters easy access to the main deck. Scaling the algae-slick hull of the ship without a rope requires a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. There are no portholes or large openings in the hull of the ship, making the main deck or quarterdeck the only way inside. All locations on the ship are identified on map 4.1.

_Soul of Winter_ comes no closer than 500 feet to the derelict. After taking the characters up to the ship, the sailors move 200 feet away from the _Emperor_ and hold their position, waiting for the characters to reappear on the upper deck with the treasure from below.

### Locations
- See [[Emperor of the Waves]] Keyed Locations

### Escape 
Shortly after _Emperor of the Waves_ was spotted drifting on the open sea, an enormous elder octopus began to stalk the ship. It has already attacked the vessel once, and that assault worsened the _Emperor_’s condition, opening up a few leaks that are now causing the hold to flood. Believing that if it waits long enough, the wreck will eventually sink beneath the surface, the octopus has remained in the area, lurking in the water a hundred feet below. (The creature is fixated on bringing down the _Emperor_ and pays no heed to _Soul of Winter_ or the rowboat that waits for the characters 200 feet away from the derelict.)

When it hears noise from the characters’ fight against the ghouls in area 12, the creature comes back for another attack. (For best dramatic effect, you should time the octopus’s reappearance to coincide with the characters’ discovery of Aubreck’s box.)

The octopus represents a real threat to the characters. As the creature attacks, emphasize the chaos that ensues in the ship. Swarms of spiders scramble across the walls and decks in a panic, assembling into ever larger masses. The ship creaks and lists more severely as something assaults it from the outside, its timbers snapping and water pouring through the widening cracks in the hull. Within moments, the characters can see the octopus’s arms snaking through breaches in the hull, grasping for anything they can wrap around. From that point on, don’t give the players the luxury of pondering their characters’ next moves. Push them to make fast decisions and do everything you can to reinforce the idea that they’re caught in a panicked flight from a sinking ship.

### Octopus Attack
The octopus’s attack shakes and tilts the ship so violently that moving around the ship becomes difficult. Any surviving monsters panic and seek to escape the ship, attacking the characters if they cross paths. If the characters make it to the upper deck, they must hail the sailors aboard the rowboat from _Soul of Winter_ and wait for the boat to reach them.

#### Movement
Movement is tricky as the ship rocks back and forth. Treat the floor as [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain). Climbing stairs or a ladder requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, unless a character has a climbing speed. On a failed check, a character falls prone in the space where the climb began.

#### Rescue
Once the characters reach area 1 and call for help, the sailors in the rowboat try to rescue them. It takes 10 rounds for the rowboat to reach the _Emperor_. Observant players might realize that the octopus is focusing its efforts on the ship. Anyone who leaps overboard or gets into the rowboat is safe from the octopus, though monsters aboard the ship that see characters in the water follow suit and might attempt to swarm the rowboat (see Other Enemies below).

#### Thrashing Tentacles
The octopus batters the ship, trying to smash holes and tearing away at any creatures it touches. The tentacles strike quickly, spearing through sides of the ship. Only luck can save the characters from being hit by them. At the start of each character’s turn, that player makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, that character takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the tentacles’ frantic thrashing. This effect also applies to the monsters aboard the ship. To keep things simple, rather than roll saving throws for them assume they take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of their turns.

#### Attacking the Octopus
A character can attempt to drive off the octopus by dealing damage to it. A character can use an action to make a ranged attack or melee attack, or to cast a spell. Assume that any attack rolls hit but are not critical hits, and disregard any effect of the attack or spell for this purpose other than the damage it deals. If the total damage from all the attacks or spells used on the character’s turn is 20 or higher, the octopus is momentarily slowed: each character does not need to make saving throws against the thrashing of the tentacles until the end of that character’s next turn.

#### Other Monsters
If the characters left any of the monsters aboard the ship alive, those creatures try to escape the _Emperor_ before it goes under. Krell and the ettercaps are intelligent enough to seek safety. They rush to the top deck and jump into the water; then, once the rowboat arrives, they try to seize it and flee. The maw demons in area 6 break free on round 2 and rush to the upper deck. They attack other creatures indiscriminately, caring only about spreading chaos. Each one assaults the closest creature that is not a demon. The vermin aboard ship flee to the upper decks, reaching area 1 by round 3. They attack the characters on sight and fight to the death.

### Moving Aubreck’s Treasure
The metal treasure box is bulky and hard to handle. Once the elder octopus attacks, and the ship is pitching and flooding, the box becomes difficult to move. One or two characters can try to carry the box. A character can use an action to pick up the box or pass it to someone else with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed check, the character drops the box. How fast someone moves with the box is based on their Strength score, as shown on the table below. If two characters carry the box, the total of their Strength scores determines how fast they can move.

|Strength (Total)|Speed Penalty|
|---|---|
|18 or higher|-10 ft.|
|12 to 17|-20 ft.|
|8 to 11|-30 ft.|
|7 or lower|Cannot move the box|

The character with the higher initiative does not move on their turn and uses an action to assist the other carrier. On the second character’s turn, both characters can move the box a distance equal to the lower of their two speeds. If the two carriers are ever separated by more than 5 feet, or if one or both are knocked prone, both of them drop the box. The size of the box prevents more than two characters from trying to carry it at the same time.

### Sequence of Events
Following is a round-by-round summary of how events progress as the octopus brings down the ship.

#### Round 1
The octopus begins its attack, wrapping itself around the ship and flailing away at the creatures inside with its tentacles, as described above in “[Thrashing Tentacles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/gos/salvage-operation#ThrashingTentacles).”

#### Round 2
The octopus’s weight and writing tentacles cause the ship to list 30 degrees to port. At the start of this round, every character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, falling prone and sliding 10 feet toward the port side on a failed save. Creatures climbing on the walls or ceiling do not need to make this saving throw. From this time on, a character who falls prone slides 10 feet toward the port side.

#### Round 3
As the octopus crushes the ship, water pours through the hull and fills area 12. Monsters found in areas 4 through 11 have fled to area 1 by this time, unless stopped by the characters. If engaged in combat, they attempt to disengage and flee. 
Any surviving ghasts in area 12 move to area 1. Unlike the other creatures aboard the ship, they stop to fight any characters they encounter but ignore spiders, Krell, and other creatures found aboard the ship. Monsters in area 1 attempt to avoid the seawater. In their frenzy, they attack any characters who emerge from below. If Krell is present, he spots the rowboat heading for the ship and attempts to seize it once it arrives. He tries to swim beneath it, hide, and then emerge to ambush the sailors aboard it.

#### Round 4
Even if the characters have not yet signaled for the rowboat to pick them up, the sailors start rowing toward the ship to stage a rescue. The rowboat approaches on the starboard side of the ship, hoping to avoid the monsters that have gathered in area 1.

#### Round 5
Areas 4 through 11 fill with water as the ship begins to slide under the waves. The port side of area 1 is level with the water, while the tilted deck keeps the starboard edge 10 feet above it.

#### Rounds 6 through 13
Starting on round 6, the waves begin to break over the ship. The port half of area 1 is 3 feet below water, while the starboard edge remains 5 feet above it.

#### Round 14
If the rowboat began its approach on round 4, it arrives at the start of this round. If [Krell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/319295-krell-grohlg) is present, as detailed above, he attempts to launch his ambush at this point.

#### Rounds 15 through 19
At the start of round 15, the ship rolls over on its port side. Everyone in area 1 is thrown into the sea, 2d20 feet in a random direction away from the capsized hull. The rowboat moves 20 feet away from the hull in a bid to avoid any monsters. Any creature that ends up in the water within 20 feet of the rowboat tries to swim toward it and board, attacking anyone who offers resistance.

#### Round 20
At the start of round 20, the ship sinks. Anyone aboard must swim to safety. The ship descends 3d20 feet at the start of each subsequent round until it hits bottom.

### Getting Off the Emperor
Once the rowboat reaches _Emperor of the Waves_ on round 14 (or perhaps sooner), the blue steel box can be handed down from the deck of the _Emperor_ into the rowboat as an action. The rowboat remains in place long enough for the box to be offloaded and for the characters to clamber aboard. Because the octopus focuses on _Emperor of the Waves_, the rowboat is not in imminent danger from the creature. A lone character trying to swim with the treasure box must succeed on a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check at the start of their turn or sink 20 feet. Two characters working together to swim and support the box take their turns simultaneously on the lower of their two initiative rolls. One character must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check at the start of the shared turn while the other character uses the [Help](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2024/rules-glossary#HelpAction) action, or both characters sink 20 feet. The two characters must remain within 5 feet of each other, or both of them drop the box. If the box is dropped in the ocean, it sinks 30 feet per round, which should quickly put it beyond the reach of most characters. The ocean in the area where the _Emperor_ drifts is two miles deep.
