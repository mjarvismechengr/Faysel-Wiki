## Overview

The party was hired by the disgraced merchant [[Aubreck Drallion]] to recover a sealed strongbox from the drifting wreck of the [[Emperor of the Waves]]. Acting through his agent [[Vertheg]], Aubreck promised a substantial reward, claiming the box contained deeds and promissory notes vital to restoring his ruined fortune.

Boarding the derelict revealed a vessel scarred by storm and violence. The upper decks were largely abandoned, while the lower holds were flooded, unstable, and infested. Within the ship, the party encountered and ultimately killed [[Krell Grohlg]], a half-orc druid who had claimed the wreck and maintained a shrine amid the ruins.

As the search reached its conclusion, the ship came under renewed attack from a massive sea creature that had been stalking it for days. The damage proved catastrophic. With the hull failing and the vessel beginning to sink, the party recovered Aubreck’s strongbox and escaped as the [[Emperor of the Waves]] was dragged beneath the sea.

Rather than returning directly to [[Seabrook]], the party made a detour to [[Oldport]] to pursue unrelated business before delivering the recovered box. Upon their return, Aubreck honored his agreement in full. With his fortune secured, he prepared to leave Seabrook permanently for [[Kalakoayan]]. Lacking the time or interest to restore his estate, he transferred ownership of Drallion Mansion to the party, formalizing their claim with a signed deed.

The salvage marked a turning point for the group. They proved themselves capable of surviving extreme risk, navigating moral and practical pressure, and emerging with tangible influence. Their actions not only restored a fallen merchant’s power but permanently anchored the party within Seabrook’s political and physical landscape.
