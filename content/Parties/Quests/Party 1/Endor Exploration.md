## Overview

At the urging of [[Keledek]], the party has entered the depths of the [[Endor Forest]] to investigate growing signs of cult activity and long-dormant ancient infrastructure. What began as reconnaissance has expanded into a broad and dangerous undertaking, one that touches on forgotten magic, primordial forces, and the hidden shape of the world beneath the trees.

The forest is not being explored as a simple wilderness, but as a network of meaningful sites. Ruins, clearings, forgotten roads, and half-buried structures form a point crawl shaped by rumor, discovery, and consequence rather than distance alone. Each location holds fragments of history or power, and travel between them is shaped by choices rather than chance.

Central to the expedition are the echogates, ancient teleportation structures scattered throughout Endor. Some are inert, others damaged or corrupted, and a few may still function. Reactivating these gates promises rapid movement and strategic advantage, but doing so risks drawing attention from forces that remember what the gates were once used for.

The party is also searching for signs of [[Hogaak]], an earth elemental titan bound long ago and now stirring beneath the forest. Keledek believes Hogaak can be located, confronted, and contained rather than destroyed. The titan’s presence warps the land, attracts cult interest, and threatens to turn Endor itself into a weapon if mishandled.

Interwoven with these objectives is the shadow of the [[Cult of Daghor]], whose agents appear to be active within the forest. Their goals are only partially understood, but their movements suggest they are seeking relics, sites of binding, or methods of awakening and control rather than simple destruction.

Alongside Keledek’s directives, each member of the party pursues personal threads tied to the forest. Visions, lost histories, unresolved pasts, and whispered names draw them toward specific locations, ensuring that no path through Endor is purely professional.
