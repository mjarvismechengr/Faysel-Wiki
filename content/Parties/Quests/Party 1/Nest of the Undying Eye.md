## Overview

While spending an evening in Oldport, the party’s night was interrupted by a scream echoing through the streets near the docks. Investigating the disturbance, they found the investigator [[Kevori Fearnehart]] kneeling over the body of her brother, Delvin, who had been murdered and left clutching a withered, desiccated eyeball. Kevori asked the party to uncover who was responsible, explaining only that her brother had been investigating a series of disappearances.

Following the trail left behind, the party uncovered a hidden cult devoted to [[Daghor Malatok]] operating within Oldport’s ancient catacombs. The cult was engaged in experimental rituals designed to extract knowledge directly from the souls of their victims, leaving bodies intact but minds shattered or erased. Using the eyeball as a guide, the party tracked the cult’s movements through collapsed tunnels and forgotten crypts beneath the city.

The party fought through the cult’s lair, killing nearly all of its members and dismantling its infrastructure. Two ritual victims were discovered during the investigation, both alive but in critical condition. Whether through distraction, haste, or indifference, the party left both victims behind. Neither survived.

At the heart of the catacombs, the party confronted the cult’s leader, [[Zalryr]]. Rather than killing him outright, they captured him alive and tortured him for information, severing one of his hands in the process. Zalryr revealed fragments of knowledge regarding the cult’s goals and its interest in ancient sites and sealed powers, though the full scope of what he knew remains uncertain.

After extracting what information they could, the party handed Zalryr over to Kevori Fearnehart. They did not learn who had originally hired her or her brother, only that their investigation had extended beyond what Oldport’s authorities were willing to address openly.

The cult cell in Oldport was effectively destroyed, but not cleanly. Knowledge was lost with the victims, secrets escaped through torture rather than justice, and the party’s involvement left ripples that would not immediately surface. What was uncovered beneath Oldport hinted at a wider network tied to Daghor Malatok, and to threats far older than the city itself.
