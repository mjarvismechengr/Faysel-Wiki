## Overview
In the first adventure arc, the [[Seaward Milkmen]] form an adventuring party. They complete several quests, garnering local fame, and meet several key NPCs around [[Seabrook]], and the greater world. As they continue on, they slowly begin to see a grand scheme forming on the horizon.

## Overview
Characters board the [[Emperor of the Waves]] and explore its decks searching for a heavy box belonging to [[Aubreck Drallion]]. As they venture into the ship’s lower decks vermin attack in close quarters. Characters who survive those threats and push on find the lowest holds flooded with seawater and infested with undead. As the characters fight their way forward in search of Aubreck’s goal, the perils of the sea finally take their delayed claim on the _Emperor_, in the form of a hungry elder octopus. This creature first assaulted the ship several days before the characters arrive. Its previous rampage failed to scuttle the ship, though the octopus succeeded in devouring or drowning almost all of its living occupants.

#### Aftermath
Having helped Aubreck regain his fortune, he owes the party more than gold. For that he is happy to let the Milkmen travel aboard any of his trade vessels (assuming they're going where the vessel is). 

#### Events between Next Quest
The party travels to [[Oldport]] to drop off [[Three Dwarves Down]] for their gig.

## Overview
As dawn approaches, the Milkmen investigate the strange happenings at [[Widow's Light]], its keeper [[Jonas Greaves]], and the thing beneath. 

#### Aftermath
Having repaired the lighthouse, [[Jonas Greaves]] appears much more lucid and less afraid. He thanks the party for their work, claiming they've "saved Oldport for a time longer." He gifts them an amulet. 

#### Events between Next Quest
The party travels back to [[Seabrook]], and meets with [[Aubreck Drallion]] who gives them their reward for [[Salvage Operation]]. He also gifts them [[Drallion Mansion]]. After that, they meet [[Patches]] and buy supplies at [[Magic Patch]] then meet with [[Riona Vex]] at the [[Mariners' Guildhall (Seabrook)]] who offers them a job clearing [[Abbey Isle]]. The party eats dinner with [[Keledek]], and discusses what they've been up to, and their next moves. Finally, the party meets with [[Sanbalet]] who also offers them the job to clear [[Abbey Isle]].
