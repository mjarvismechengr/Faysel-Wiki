## Overview

The Seaward Milkmen first came together in [[Seabrook]] for reasons that were small and practical. Coin. Curiosity. Proximity. Their earliest work kept them close to the coast and its quiet dangers, beginning with rumors of a haunted [[Alchemist's House]] overlooking the cliffs. What they found there was not a ghost, but a living criminal network. By choosing negotiation over slaughter, the Milkmen established a pattern that would follow them throughout the arc. They survived by understanding when to cut throats and when to shake hands.

That choice carried them outward. At sea, they were hired to reclaim a fortune thought lost aboard the doomed [[Emperor of the Waves]]. The job forced them into collapsing hulls, flooded holds, and a race against a sinking ship. They returned alive, wealthy, and marked as capable. [[Aubreck Drallion]], restored by their success, became both patron and proof that the Milkmen were no longer just local muscle.

Their growing reputation drew them inland to [[Oldport]], where violence hid behind culture and decay. A scream in the streets led them beneath the city and into their first direct encounter with the [[Cult of Daghor]]. There, they uncovered rituals meant to strip memory and knowledge from living minds. The cult’s leader was captured and broken for information. Two victims were found alive and left behind. Some knowledge was saved. More was lost forever. The Milkmen left Oldport changed, whether they admitted it or not.

Before departing the city, they turned their attention to [[Widow’s Light]], a lighthouse whose failing beacon concealed a truth far older than Oldport itself. Rather than descend into what lay beneath, they chose restraint. By repairing the light and reinforcing its ancient runes, they forced an unnamed horror back into slumber. The keeper, [[Jonas Greaves]], regained his clarity. Oldport was spared a disaster it never knew it faced.

Returning to Seabrook, the Milkmen found themselves courted by competing interests. The [[Mariners' Guild]] sought control of [[Abbey Isle]] for a lighthouse. [[Sanbalet]] sought answers, leverage, and profit. The party chose the latter. On the island, they dismantled a stranded Daghor cult cell, navigated betrayal and internal fracture, and uncovered a hidden vault known as the Winding Way. They left the isle stripped of its secrets, its cult destroyed, and its surface truth carefully managed.

By the end of the arc, the Milkmen were no longer simply adventurers. They owned property in Seabrook. They held favors with smugglers and merchants. They had crossed paths with forbidden texts, soul magic, and ancient bindings. They had prevented catastrophes and caused quieter harms. And through dinners, conversations, and subtle guidance, figures like [[Keledek]] had begun to take an interest in where they were going next.

What began as coastal work had revealed something larger taking shape beyond the horizon.
