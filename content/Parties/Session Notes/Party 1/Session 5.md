| [[Emperor of the Waves]] cargo hold | While searching for [[Aubreck Drallion]]'s chest Bardock fell through the rotting floorboards into waist-deep water, where he was immediately confronted by three undead creatures. Bhodi, seizing the moment, leapt down and delivered a devastating **People’s Elbow** to one of the ghasts. Bardock, Bhodi, and Lucian engaged in close combat while Dotrice, Altair, and Arthur provided ranged support from above. After the fight, , Bardock, Bhodi, and Lucian discovered a large chest marked with the letter **D**. Inside, they found a smaller, heavy blue metal box.|
| [[Emperor of the Waves]] escape | Massive tentacles blow through the hull, and crush the ship. As water filled the lower decks Bhodi and Bardock struggled to carry the box up to the top deck, while the others scamper up as fast as possible.  |
| [[Emperor of the Waves]] top deck | On the top deck Arthur and Lucian are attacked by Maw Demons. The creatures spewed acidic bile, knocking both Lucian and Altair unconscious. As Lucian teetered on the brink of death, the stirring notes of Dotrice’s bardic magic revived him just in time to rejoin the battle. With the Maw Demons defeated, the adventurers made their final push to escape. Clutching the mysterious chest, they fled the sinking vessel and were rescued by the dwarves from the [[Soul of Winter]] just as the _Emperor of the Waves_ was pulled beneath the surface. |
