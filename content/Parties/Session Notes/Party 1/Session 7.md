### Events

Date: 24th - 29th of [[Iskel]]

| Scenes | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[Widow's Light]] | [[The Thing Beneath]] |
| [[Soul of Winter]] | A 4 day journey with no issues or significant events. |
| [[Drallion Mansion]] | Upon arriving in [[Seabrook]], the party was brought to the mansion by [[Vertheg]], whereupon [[Aubreck Drallion]] paid the party for their services. In addition, he gave the party his mansion before leaving town. The stipulation was that they actually use it (can't be sold, etc.). |
| [[Magic Patch]] | The Milkmen went into town and met [[Patches]]. They solved a riddle as well as traded for goods. While shopping, [[Bodhi Orsimer]] was notified that [[Sanbalet]] wanted a word with the party about some work he needed done. Upon leaving, a messenger from the [[Mariners' Guild]] had a similar message from the guildhall. |
| [[Mariners' Guildhall (Seabrook)]] | [[Riona Vex]], the local guildmaster offered the party a job to clear [[Abbey Isle]] of its inhabitants so they could erect a new lighthouse. According to her, the isle's occupants are dark clerics and they've never been able to get onto the island without huge loss of life, but recently there's been an attack by pirates and there's a small window  to secure it for the guild. She gave the party until morning to decide. |
| [[Keledek Tower]] | The Milkmen spoke with [[Keledek]] over a bowl of his ghost pepper goat curry that he lovingly named Keledek's Revenge after an experience of nearly being trampled by a goat. The party told him of their work in the south ([[Salvage Operation]], [[Nest of the Undying Eye]], [[The Thing Beneath]]), and together they decided that this cult may very well become a problem, if they haven't become one already. Keledek told the party about several things including: <br/><br/>- [[Candelabra]] (Mage Guild), [[Luthra Waggletop]] (Archmage of Artifice), [[The Orrery of Brass]] (Her tower or "Candle") <br/><br/>- His current research regarding a series of standing stones he calls "Echo Gates." He believes these Echo Gates are actually nodes connecting a vast and ancient teleportation network. He's already found two, one north of [[Grenevik]] at the foot of the [[Jotunspire Peaks]], and one in [[Seabrook]] ([[Standing Stones (Seabrook)]]). <br/><br/>- Several personal conversations ([[Arthur Mourhan]], [[Bardock 1563]], [[Rex Tinker]]). <br/><br/>Based on the map found in [[Oldport]], Keledek suspects that the cult is interested in something within the [[Endor Forest]]. He's asked the party to find a black sapphire on [[Abbey Isle]] to help him open / repair the Echo Gate in [[Seabrook]]. He has asked the party to find and activate other Echo Gates within the forest and in return, they may use them. The party entrusted Keledek with the key they found in [[Oldport]], and used a zone of truth spell to ensure he wouldn't "let it fall into the wrong hands or use it for bad." |
