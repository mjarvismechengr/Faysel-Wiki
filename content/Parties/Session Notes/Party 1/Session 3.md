| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Reading Time    | After letting [[Sanbalet]] off the hook, the party took some time to read some books they found, including [[Edge of the Day]], [[The Magical Properties of Gemstones]], [[The Chains of Divinity]], and attempted to read both [[Ye Secret of Ye Philosopher's Stone]] and [[Common Necromancy]] without success. |
| The [[Empty Net]]      | [[Lucian]] asked around for information in a shady tavern. There he met the half-orc [[Vertheg]] who informed him of his employer's job opportunity.           |
| [[Keledek Tower]]      | The Milkmen visit the local wizard, [[Keledek]], in hopes of selling some books. They learned that there's a Black Sapphire on [[Abbey Isle]] that he's willing to trade for information regarding [[Common Necromancy]]. They also learned that [[Eliander Fireborn]] holds a vast library, and may be interested in buying books.           |
| Meeting with [[Aubreck Drallion]]      | The party meets with [[Vertheg]]'s employer, a former merchant, who offers them a job to retrieve his lockbox of promissory notes and land deeds from a ship of his that bankrupt him when it went missing years ago. They accepted the offer.        |
| Gambling      | [[Bardock 1563]] tinkered, [[Dotrice]] played music, [[Arthur Mourhan]] went to bed feeling ill, while the other three party members gambled, playing an outdated version of [[Dice Hydras]] after which they rested and started their journey aboard the [[Soul of Winter]].        |
