### Events

Date: 30th - 32nd of [[Iskel]]


| Scenes | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[Keledek Tower]] | The party visited Keledek at his tower who then escorted them to [[Seabrook Island]] containing the [[Standing Stones (Seabrook)]]. He returned the Black Sapphire to the party and explained how it can be used to trap [[Hogaak]], a giant earth elemental titan. The party was warned to remain alert for cult activity. Keledek provided instructions on how to mend Echo Gates and a Rune stone required to access Echo Gates. Runes on Echo Gates must be clean for the stones to function. |
| Town Council Meeting | The meeting was led by Eliander in the [[Council Hall (Seabrook)]]. The Kingdom of Thrane formally offered annexation of Seabrook. Thrane’s proposal, ([[Annexation Offer to Seabrook]]) includes increased security and protection of trade routes, construction of a stone wall and two additional watchtowers in return for a significant tax increase. Public sentiment in Seabrook is largely against annexation, with many citizens believing the town can protect itself. A final vote is scheduled in five days. One concrete incident cited in the meeting was that of [[Raiders in Winskey]]. The [[Gilded Compass]] (a rival adventuring party) suspects an active smuggling ring operating within Seabrook after they took up the quest to clear [[Abbey Isle]] from the [[Mariners' Guild]]. They're currently investigating local smuggling. |
| [[Tin Tunnels Mine]] | After resting, The party traveled north along the [[Shepherd's Highway]] to the mine. Before entering the mine, the party stopped at The Miner’s Respite, a tavern outside the mine entrance. The party played a game of Goblins Eye Darts, which Arthur won, and Rex talked with one of his father's old friends, [[Durn Firebrand]]. Durn is also the father of one of Rex's childhood friends, [[Bigsby Firebrand]]. At the mining office, [[Seabrook Town Council]] member and head of the mining operation, [[Manistrad Copperlocks]], requested help dealing with disturbances underground. The mine is actively extracting silver, but hoping to hit mithral. Inside the mine the party encountered and defeated three rust monsters. Using old carts and crates, the party blocked off a hole at the end of the mine to prevent further incursions from the underdark. |
| Manticore Hunt | Manistrad Copperlocks offered the party 500 GP to deal with a nearby manticore which they tracked down and defeated the manticore in the nearby hills. Arthur successfully harvested the creature’s pelt. After collecting the reward, Manistrad, as a town council member, expressed cautious support for Thrane’s annexation, believing security concerns outweigh the costs. |
| [[Seabrook]] | Back in Seabrook, the party visited [[Kester's Leather Goods]] whereupon the manticore pelt was sold and Bodhi and Altair received matching leather-wrapped weapon hilts. |
| [[Lucian's Cabin]] | The party traveled to Lucian’s cabin in the woods, east of [[Seabrook]]. The journey was marked by eerie weather, but no encounters occurred. Inside, they read the following books from Lucian's Collection: <br/>- [[Runic Fragmenta]]: Bodhi recognized two runes matching those on his helm, one meaning “Conquer.” The sigil on Bardock translates to “Protect.” <br/>- [[The Witch's Lexicon]] <br/>- [[The Stilltongue Alchemist]]: Arthur is personally familiar with this malady, though the rest of the party is not aware of its significance. <br/>- [[The Severed Veil - Curses and Afflictions]]: Altair noticed several symptoms described match signs Arthur has been exhibiting. <br/> As the party rested, Lucian had a dream of a darkly dressed woman beckoning him to the far east. |
