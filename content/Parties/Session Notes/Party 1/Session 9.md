### Events

Date: 29th of [[Iskel]].

| Scenes | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| Sand Dunes | The Milkmen decided to kill [[Odium]]. As he was getting away [[Lucian]] slit his throat. |
| Abbey Stairway Fight | The party tied [[Ozymandias]] up and brought him back to the stairway into the Abbey cellar. [[Lucian]] threatened him into asking for help from his crew inside. Fighting broke out, with [[Ogmund]] being taken down by [[Bodhi Orsimer]] who then threw him down the stairs like a bowling ball. [[Ozymandias]] escaped momentarily, but once most of the enemies at the abbey were subdued, [[Bayleaf]] the half-elf decided in the end to help us. He helped subdue Ozymandias. |
| Around the Cellar | [[Bayleaf]] showed the party around the rooms of the cellar. Odium's room had lots of mini statues and two life size ones. One of which was an imposing figure in armor on a horse with a flaming sword. [[Bodhi Orsimer]] toppled them and [[Odium's Book]] was found in the rubble. Several scrolls were found in other rooms and [[Dotrice]] found a book series titled [[Skies of Sulfur]]. Bayleaf showed the party a hidden entrance to "The Winding Way" behind some curtains in a room of worship. Under a zone of truth, he said he was simply on the isle as a mercenary to train the guard. [[Ozymandias]] under the zone said he had no idea the Winding Way was there. |
| The Winding Way | Bayleaf turned invisible and tried to escape when forced to lead into the winding way. [[Bardock 1563]] stopped him. [[Ozymandias]] instead led the way down the first tunnel. When he reached the first room he looked terrified then fell to the floor dead. The party took a rest during which [[Lucian]] pondered the roots of fear. As the party gathered themselves and went back down the passage, [[Dotrice]] looked into the black and fell unconscious. |
