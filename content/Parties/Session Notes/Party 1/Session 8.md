### Events

Date: 29th of [[Iskel]]

| Scenes | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[Alchemist's House]] | [[Sanbalet]] give us an offer to go to [[Abbey Isle]] for him: <br/> - Sanbalet wants to know if his buyers are still there, they have not been active. <br/> - Sanbalet deals directly with the Clerics. <br/> - Reward of 2000 GP finder fee for making sure his buyers are still there. <br/> - Anything we find is ours to keep. <br/><br/>We debate for a long time whether to take his offer or take the offer of the [[Mariners' Guild]]. (Like, FAR too long, but this becomes a theme of the evening…). <br/> - [[Altair Flickerfoot]] casts Augury trying to figure out if it is a good decision to go with Sanbalet in the moment. <br/>    - Response comes back as weal and woe, meaning there will be good and bad as a result of choosing to accept Sanbalet’s offer. <br/>One common thought is to try and have the best of both worlds and undercut the Mariner’s guild by telling them we didn’t find anything. We agree to accept Sanbalet’s offer and head to his ship. |
| [[The Sea Ghost]] | We meet [[Captain Sigurd]] (AKA Cpt. Snake Eyes). [[Lucian]] feels a calming feeling from the weather as we travel on the boat out to the Isle. |
| [[Abbey Isle]] Arrival | - Large, jagged cliffs, only way to get on the island is through the small beach on the southern tip. <br/>- Capt. Snake Eyes will only wait for us for one day and then he is leaving. <br/><br/>We traverse through large dunes which appear to be booby trapped, we make our way through most of the dunes but then make a wrong step and get attacked by a group of skeletons, which we handle easily. Dotrice uses a spell to ask the dead three questions, and even though he bombs the third question, we manage to find out we need to go North.  |
| Abbey Ruins | We arrive to the Abbey, it is burned down into rubble. There are stone staircase that look intriguing. At the bottom of the staircase is a large door. [[Dotrice]] knocks the door open and random beings come running out. We manage to deescalate the situation by telling them we are from Sanbalet and are not there to fight. We talked to [[Ozymandias]] (Leader and “Keeper of What Remains”) and try to explain why we are there. <br/>- He very adamantly lets us know that he just wants to get off the island. <br/>- We recognize the cloaks they are wearing as the same ones from the cult members who were sucking up memories in [[Oldport]]. |
| Walk Back to the Ship | We leave with Ozy, two of his guards, and [[Odium]], a small rat boy who really wanted to leave and come with us. Along the walk, Odium tells Dotrice that us he will help us if we kill Ozy. He tells us he will help us find whatever we want. We decide to trust him and surprise attack Ozy and the guards. We knock out Ozy and kill the guards. We search Ozy for goods and find an amulet off him which has the engraving of an emaciated hand and an eyeball ([[Bodhi Orsimer]] takes it). Odium tells us about the lord they worship, [[Daghor Malatok]], who is all about bringing back those who die, and defeating death. We ask Odium to draw a map of the Abbey. |
| The Debate | The session ends with a very long and extended debate on what our next move should be. Essentially, we need to decide if we are going all in with trusting Odium: <br/>- This would mean we kill Ozy and take Odium back to the Abbey and trust that they will follow him and he is actually able to help us find the stone. <br/><br/>Second option is go with Ozy: <br/>- This would mean killing Odium, convincing Ozy that the whole ambush was Odium. And then assuming that Ozy will help us. <br/><br/>Up until now, Ozy has not really shown any signs of helping us, he acts like he is better than us, and will not tell us anything until we are back on land. Also, the fact that they had the same cloaks as the bad cult is worrisome. <br/>- He doesn’t know about any special stones (we did not directly ask him about the Black Sapphire) <br/><br/>On the other hand, Odium has zero credentials and no reason for us to believe he knows anything other than his word. He seemed willing to do or say anything to get off the island |
