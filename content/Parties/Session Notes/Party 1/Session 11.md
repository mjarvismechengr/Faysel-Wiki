| [[Drallion Mansion]] | [[Vertheg]] let's Milkmen know he's staying on to see the house returned to its former glory. He asks the party what they require, and he'll acquire it. |

| [[Keledek Tower]] | Party talked with [[Keledek]] about their journey to [[Abbey Isle]], gave him the black sapphire to study. He answered questions about the [[Candelabra]], [[Hogaak]], [[Alchemy Ingredients in Marshfield]], how to open [[Common Necromancy]], and told the party to return to pick up the black sapphire and key to the teleportation network he's been studying. |
| [[Winston's Store]] | Party bought a map of [[Isomar]] and one of the [[Endor Forest]]. He told them about a group of adventurers known as the [[Gilded Compass]]. |
| [[Mariners' Guildhall (Seabrook)]] | [[Riona Vex]] told the party she was saddened by their lack of professionalism in not informing her of their decision not to accept the job. She hired the [[Gilded Compass]] to do it instead. |
| [[Council Hall (Seabrook)]] | Party talked briefly with [[Eliander Fireborn]], who told them about the town potentially joining the [[Kingdom of Thrane]] for security against smugglers, bandits, and raiders. He invited them to his library later in the day. |
| [[The Wicker Goat]] | Talked with the barkeep [[Thessa Brewthorn]] about [[Raiders in Winskey]]. She mentioned the holy war between the [[Dimaheim Horde]] and the [[Shimazu Shogunate]]. |
| [[Eliander's House]] | [[Eliander Fireborn]] showed the party to his library, where he lent them a book: [[The Faiths of Faysel. Gods, Cultures and the Shape of Belief ]], hoping it would help them learn a bit more about the cult they've encountered.
