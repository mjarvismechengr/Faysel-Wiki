### Events

Date: 29th of [[Iskel]]

| Scenes | Details |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[Abbey Isle]] - The Winding Way | We continue to search the burned out annex. We start by facing off with the 2 specters, 2 minotaur skeletons and a bodak. After some back and forth we overcome them and discover a maze like dungeon as we progress through the maze we discover, sometimes safely others not so much, that it is full of traps. |
| False Treasure Room | Finally we come upon a treasure room. As we investigate we realize its all an illusion and a stone statue at the middle of the room comes to life to attack us (due to Lucian's gyrating worship of the statue). Using [[Ozymandias]]'s amulet we are able to pacify the stone and we discover a secret passage to the real treasure room. |
| Treasure Room | We retrieve all we can, hop in the rowboat and make our way back to the ship. |
