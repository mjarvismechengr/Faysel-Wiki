## Overview 

Al'Dira is a continent in the far east of [[Faysel]]. It is connected by land to [[Isomar]] to its north, the [[Sunset Sea]] lies to the west, the [[Tiber Ocean]] to the east, the [[Nagaru Ocean]] to the south, and the continent of [[Wanakona]] on the border to between both oceans to Al'Dira's southeast.

Al'Dira is famed for the [[Maru Desert]], the largest desert on the planet that lies in its center. Al'Dira is also home to part of the tallest mountain range in the world, the [[Sky Razor Range]], running north to south along its eastern edge. 

Despite the harsh terrain, people throughout history have flourished here. [[Matroh]] is one of the largest cities in the world and [[Kingdom of Esjiq]] is a powerful nation. Al’Dira is widely regarded as a land where survival is earned rather than given, and where faith, tradition, and discipline have allowed civilizations to endure where others would have collapsed.
