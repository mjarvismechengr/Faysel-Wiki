## Overview 

By landmass, Tekislar is perhaps the largest continent, though that is up for some debate. It lies in the northwest quadrant of the world, with the [[Tiber Ocean]] to its west, the [[Stormwind Ocean]] to its east, and [[Mangchida Ocean]] to the south. It is a fair distance from the other continents, making it the most remote continent by a large margin. 

Tekislar is made up of several distinct regions including the [[Sapphire Sea]] which sits within the eastern portion of the continent, a large grassland in the middle of the continent, and the west is occupied by mountains. 

The peoples of Tekislar vary wildly, with the area surrounding the [[Sapphire Sea]] extending west into the grasslands controlled by the [[Merin Empire]], though most of the grasslands, mountains, valleys, and forests to the west controlled by the Argden Tribes. The southwestern peninsula is the territory of the [[Rajayan Mandala]]. 

Tekislar is often described as a continent too vast and too old to ever be fully claimed, where empires rise along its edges but fade as they press inward.
