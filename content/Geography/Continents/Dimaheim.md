## Overview 

The continent of Dimaheim lay at the far north of the world. It includes a large peninsula connected to northwestern [[Isomar]], and an island off the southwestern tip of the peninsula. Dimaheim serves as the border between the [[Siren Sea]] to its southeast and [[Stormwind Ocean]] to the northwest.

Dimaheim is highlighted by the [[Jotunspire Peaks]] that run east to west through the center of the continent. On the north side of the mountains lies the [[Thrymholt Glacier]] and a vast expanse of frozen tundra, while the south side of the mountains holds fjords of every size, forests, and coastal grasslands. 

The continent's population is largely spread among remote villages and wandering tribes, though the city of [[Grenevik]] acts a pseudo capital for the various peoples in the region. Though no formal government exists, the [[Dimaheim Horde]] operates as a coalition of tribal warriors to protect the freedoms and autonomy of each tribe against large foreign threats. 

To its people, Dimaheim is not a land to be ruled, but one to be survived, and any power that threatens that balance is met with swift and often brutal resistance.
