## Overview 
Aetheria translates to "Realm of Gods," and it's theorized that this was the land where the gods lived upon their arrival to [[Faysel]]. It lies hidden within the rough waters of the south [[Mangchida Ocean]]. 

The land is strangely shattered, with the land looking unnaturally broken. It holds biomes of every type and what's even stranger is that they aren't always where they'd be expected. 

No one controls the land, nor even knows of its existence though some hypothesize about its existence.
