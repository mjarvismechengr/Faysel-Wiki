## Overview 

Wanakona is a "continent" only in memory. Though broadly considered to once have been a peninsula off of the southern coast of [[Al'Dira]], it is now a series of islands between the [[Nagaru Ocean]] and [[Tiber Ocean]]. Wanakona means "birthplace of dragons." In legend, the gods tore land from [[Al'Dira]] and [[Wanakona]] then used it to create [[Manai]], leaving the [[Dragon Scar Sea]] and the islands that remain. 

The islands hold various biomes, including highlands, cliffs, forests, swamps, and mountains, but the legendary [[Mistspires]] are spoken of even in far flung villages across the world. Since it's shattering, the islands of Wanakona have become a nexus of planar activity, with rifts opening and closing regularly.   

Wanakona is controlled by a pseudo-governmental organization known as the [[Riftguard]], that watches over the many planar rifts in the area. Most of Wankona's people are concentrated in the city of [[Amytherian]], with other small towns, and outposts dotting the islands.

Though steeped in legend, Wanakona is feared as much as it is revered, its shattered geography and unstable reality serving as a reminder of the cost of divine intervention.
