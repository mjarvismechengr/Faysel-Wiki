## Overview 

Aequitorra roughly translates to "Center of the World" which is fitting for a continent that is located along [[Faysel]]'s equator, and prime meridian. It is bordered by the [[Blood Sea]] and [[Sunset Sea]] to the east, the [[Mangchida Ocean]] to its west, [[Nagaru Ocean]] to the south, the [[Siren Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Stormwind Ocean]] to the north west, and the continent [[Yoseju]] to the north across the [[Kazenochi Strait]]. 

Though it possesses biomes of almost every kind, Aequitorra is a land most famous for the mysterious [[Jvarro Jungle]], which makes up a large portion of its northern landmass. Despite its central location on the planet It is arguably the least inhabited continent per square mile, in part due to the dense jungle, but also because the [[Ixchitl Cordillera]] provides a natural barrier to the southwestern portion of the continent. 

Aequitorra's remote nature has stifled the need and ability of any large scale government growth. The population mostly resides in small self governing villages with only one large city, [[Kalakoayan]], which acts as a continental trade hub. Most of the islands in the [[Blood Sea]] are also considered to be part of the continent. 

To outsiders, Aequitorra is seen as a land that should be central to the world, yet remains stubbornly distant, its jungles, mountains, and seas resisting conquest as if the continent itself prefers to be left alone.
