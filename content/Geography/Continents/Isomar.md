## Overview 

Though not geographically so, Isomar is the center of the world for all intents and purposes. Connected by land to its south is [[Al'Dira]], and to the northwest lies [[Dimaheim]]. To the west is the [[Siren Sea]], and to the east is the [[Tiber Ocean]]. 

Isomar has most biomes, including the [[Sky Razor Range]], the [[Stovlok Sea]], the [[Gold Grass Prairie]], various forests, and a large swathe of tundra. 

The continent is accepted as the center of the world for numerous reasons but at the heart is the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. They control the southern portion of the continent from the [[Siren Sea]] in the west to the [[Sky Razor Range]] in the east. Their capital is the largest city in the world, [[Independence]], which is on the [[Siren Coast]]. Thrane also has a great volume of cities, and peoples, along with its central location makes the continent a hot spot for trade, and travel. 

Isomar’s prominence comes at a cost, as its roads, ports, and cities are constant battlegrounds of politics, ambition, and competing interests, making stability here a fragile and hard-won thing.
