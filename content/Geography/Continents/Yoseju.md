## Overview 

Yoseju is a continent made up of two major islands that act as the border between the [[Stormwind Ocean]] to their west and the [[Sunset Sea]] to their east. The continent of [[Dimaheim]] lies to the north, and [[Aequitorra]] lies to the south across the [[Kazenochi Strait]]. 

The jagged mountain range known as the [[Devil's Spine]] dominates the continent, running north to south. Other notable features are the jungles in the south, and grasslands in the west. 

Given its size, the population of Yoseju is very high, though most of that number stems from two cities, [[Inzai]], and [[Orint]]. The continent is controlled by five warlords and their clans, known as the [[Shimazu Shogunate]]. 

Life in Yoseju is defined by loyalty, discipline, and rivalry, with generations raised to expect conflict as a constant and necessary force in maintaining balance.
