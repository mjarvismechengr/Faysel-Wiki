## Overview

[[The Soul of Winter]] is a sturdy dwarven sailing ship known for its reliability and discipline rather than speed or elegance. The ship operates as a hire-for-service vessel, taking contracts for transporting goods, passengers, or expedition parties. Its reputation is one of professionalism rather than secrecy.

The crew consists of thirty dwarves, most of them seasoned sailors and former guards accustomed to holding a line under pressure. Discipline aboard the ship is strict but fair, and watches are kept with military precision. The crew’s loyalty is first and foremost to their captain.

The ship is commanded by [[Wolgar Windrune]], a pragmatic and steady leader who values preparation, contracts, and clear expectations. Wolgar is not known for flowery words or heroic bravado, but his judgment is widely trusted among merchants and explorers alike.

The Soul of Winter was the vessel hired by [[Aubreck Drallion]] to transport the Seaward Milkmen to the wreck of the [[Emperor of the Waves]]. The successful completion of that voyage further cemented the ship’s reputation as a dependable choice for dangerous work, even when the destination itself is anything but safe.
