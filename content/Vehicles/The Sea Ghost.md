## Overview

The Sea Ghost is a lean, fast coastal sloop used by [[Sanbalet's Gang]] to move contraband along the [[Siren Coast]], running quiet routes between small coves, half-forgotten docks, and offshore rendezvous points. To outsiders it reads as a hard-working merchant boat with a disciplined crew. To anyone who knows what to look for, it is a professional smuggling operation built around speed, secrecy, and plausible deniability.

Recently, the Sea Ghost sailed toward [[Abbey Isle]] to rendezvous with a “buyer” cell. From a distance the crew saw smoke rising and received no response to signaling. [[Captain Sigurd]] judged the meet compromised and pulled back into deeper water rather than risk reefs, ambush, or a desperate boarding action. The ship kept its distance and waited for new orders that never came.

When the Seaward Milkmen later used the Sea Ghost for passage, the vessel’s real character showed through. Its crew did not posture like pirates and did not welcome questions like honest sailors. Every interaction carried the same message: you are on their deck by contract, not by trust. The Sea Ghost is not infamous because it is brutal. It is infamous because it is careful.
