## Overview

[[The Typhoon]] is one of the [[Relics of Sundering]], the personal vessel of [[Iskandar]]. It was said to carry him across seas and skies alike, unconstrained by wind, wave, or horizon.

Accounts of the Typhoon are famously inconsistent. Some tales describe it as a towering warship crowned with lightning and black sails. Others claim it was no larger than a fishing boat, humble in form but impossible to catch.

What remains constant across every telling is its speed. The Typhoon is universally described as the fastest vessel to ever exist. It outran squalls, crossed oceans in a night, and vanished over the horizon before pursuit could even be considered. Some myths insist it did not merely sail upon the wind, but commanded it, bending storms into pathways and calm seas into launchways.

Sailors still swear that during the fiercest storms, a silhouette can be seen riding the clouds or cutting across impossible waves. When that happens, the wise lower their sails and give thanks, believing the storm has already chosen its course.
