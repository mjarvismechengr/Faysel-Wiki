## Overview


## Keyed Locations
### Main / Upper Decks
#### 1 - Main Decks
> The _Emperor_’s upper decks slope gently down toward the ship’s port side. The forecastle and quarterdeck are empty, and short wooden stumps are all that remain of the ship’s masts. The double doors leading to cabins fore and aft appear intact, as does the metal grate in the deck that offers access to the lower decks. Aside from the rhythmic creak of the ship’s badly weathered timbers, all seems quiet.

This area is unoccupied. The doors to fore and aft are not locked (but see area 3), and the ship’s wheel turns easily and freely. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence check determines that the wheel is no longer connected to the ship’s rudder, and it can’t be used to steer the ship until the vessel undergoes extensive repairs.

The deck is marred in places by bloodstains, noticeable to someone who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check thereafter reveals that the stains are about three days old.

Through the grate set into the deck can be seen a ladder extending down to area 5, but the grate is rusted shut. It can be wrenched open with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or smashed apart (AC 15; 10 hit points; immunity to fire, poison, and psychic damage). Anyone who peers down into area 5 after the grate is removed and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots several fist-sized [spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775844-spider) crawling along the walls of the passage below. The spiders immediately scuttle away from any noise or light.

#### 2- Altar to Loth 
> A rough stone altar dominates this cabin. Strange markings cover its surface, dried mud cakes the floor around it, and humanoid skulls ring the wall above, each mounted on a wooden spike. The corners of this room are piled with garbage and debris — crudely cut wooden logs, smashed furniture, torn sacks, shattered crates, and small piles of dried palm fronds. A staircase descends from the southeast corner, and an acrid odor fills the air.

This chamber was once the captain’s cabin. Now it’s a shrine to Lolth, the demon queen of spiders. The skulls are cracked, weathered, and obviously old.

Lurking under the garbage and debris is a host of vermin held sacred by the cultists of Lolth — spiders of every size and type. If anyone other than the druid Krell spends more than a few moments in this room, one [giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775821-giant-spider) bursts from the webs on the port side, while an [ettercap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194989-ettercap) emerges from the starboard side of the room. At the same time, four [swarms of insects (spiders)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/301414-swarm-of-insects-spiders) crawl through the deck from below. Any character who has a passive Perception score of 14 or lower is surprised. (In tight quarters, remember that a swarm can occupy the same space as another creature.)

**_Captain’s Log._** A character who searches through the debris in the room and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check finds the ship’s ledger and the captain’s log, both written in Common.

The log details the ship’s last voyage, including an account of the terrible storm that threw _Emperor of the Waves_ off course and separated it from its escort. Running low on food and drinkable water, the ship was forced to drop anchor off an uncharted island. The last entry describes an attack by orcs that fought alongside goblins and monstrous vermin. Though the crew fended off this initial attack, they suffered heavy casualties. The final entry records the captain’s fear that this attack might have been the precursor to an even larger assault.

**_Treasure._** A minor offering to Lolth is concealed by the mud and litter on the deck. A search of the cabin uncovers a small sack containing ten red rubies (100 gp each).

#### 3 - Navigator's Room
The door into this room from the main deck is held shut by a thick mass of webbing behind it. It can be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or broken through (AC 15, 18 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, resistance to piercing and slashing damage).

Sheets of webbing fill this room, such that anything more than 10 feet from the entrance appears as little more than a vague shape. Hidden in the webs are a narrow staircase down and, near the bow, a table and four chairs.

The weathered furniture here is worthless, but the table is still covered with charts and maps.

A [giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775821-giant-spider) and an [ettercap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194989-ettercap) lurk near the ceiling above the table, completely hidden in webbing and shadow. They attack the first creature to examine the charts and maps, gaining surprise unless the creature has a passive Perception score of 17 or higher.

Combat in this area arouses the hungry vermin in the decks below. Beginning 1d4 rounds after the giant spider’s initial attack, one [swarm of insects (spiders)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/301414-swarm-of-insects-spiders) boils up the stairs from area 4 each round, using the same initiative count as the giant spider. The swarms keep coming until four have entered the fight, unless the passage from area 4 is blocked somehow. Each swarm attacks the nearest creature.

### Lower Deck and Cargo Hold
#### 4 - Webbed Doorway
This area is not shrouded in sheets of webs, unlike most of the lower deck (see the “Webs Aboard Ship” sidebar). A web of a different sort stretches across the doorway between this small chamber and the west end of area 5 (at the point marked with a dotted line). This freshly spun web is difficult to spot. A character who probes ahead with a pole or a weapon, or who has a passive Perception score of 17 or higher, can spot the web. Otherwise, the first character through the doorway blunders into it and is restrained, as if they had been hit by a giant spider’s Web attack.

If any creature is caught in the web, the occupants of area 5 are drawn into this area and attack immediately.

**_Treasure._** A fine silver bracelet (250 gp) can be found on the floor against the wall in the northeast corner of this area.

#### 5 - Spider Nest
The north–south section of this hallway is filled with sheets of webbing (see the sidebar).

An [ettercap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194989-ettercap) lurks in here, latching onto the ceiling over the door to area 6. Two [giant wolf spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195033-giant-wolf-spider) are perched on either side of the doorway from area 4. They attack, gaining surprise over any creature with a passive Perception score of 16 or lower, when any creature is caught by the web in the doorway leading from area 4 or when any creature enters area 5 after that web is removed. Six [swarms of insects (spiders)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/301414-swarm-of-insects-spiders) lie elsewhere in this area, with two swarms joining the fight each round.

If the characters enter this passageway from area 10 instead of from area 4, the spiders wait until the characters’ attention is focused on the deck grate (see below) before attacking.

**_Cargo Hold Access._** A wooden grate covers a hole in the deck that leads down to area 12. The grate is badly rotted and covered in webs, and its unsafe nature can be noticed only by a character who probes the floor ahead with a pole or who has a passive Perception score of 14 or higher. A character who puts their full weight on the grate breaks through and falls into the cargo hold (area 12). The fall into the water filling the hold deals no damage, but it catches the attention of the ghouls in the hold. The grate can be opened or broken through easily by anyone who recognizes its condition before moving onto it.

#### 6 - Food Storage
> Thick webbing chokes this room, partially covering strung-up bones, shriveled limbs of humanoids and animals, and other gruesome remains. Four human-sized bundles hang within the mass of webbing, a little less than ten feet into the room, while small spiders scurry everywhere.

A character who watches the webbed bundles for a few moments and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices that they occasionally shudder and twitch in a way not caused by the motion of the _Emperor_. Within are four [maw demons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17235-maw-demon), servitors drawn from the Abyss by the fiendish magic coursing through the webs here. Krell and the other cultists spent many hours here sanctifying the webs and offering rites to Lolth, and the goddess has rewarded them with these servitors. Krell has yet to free them, because he worries he is not currently strong enough to command them.

Each cocoon can be torn open with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, or it can be attacked (AC 10; 10 hit points; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). When the first demon is set loose, the others become agitated and can use an action to tear their way out of the webbing.

**_Treasure._** A few bones and skulls of sacrificial victims are hidden in the webbing. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check finds a pair of gold earrings (200 gp) and a vine necklace set with an amethyst (250 gp), and [Two-Birds Sling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1752531-two-birds-sling) hidden among the webs.

#### 7 - Krell's Cabin
> Palm fronds are piled up in one corner of this room to make a crude bed. Nearby, a stone-tipped wooden spear and an oblong shield lean against the wall. The shield bears the symbol of a humanoid skull with spiders crawling from its eye sockets. Two weathered humanoid skulls hang from wooden pegs on the wall.

This room serves as Krell Grohlg’s personal chamber. Unlike most of the lower deck, it is not covered in sheets of webs. Ever since the attack by the octopus killed the other cultists a few days ago, he has abandoned this room and spends most of his time praying in area 10.

Any character who inspects the bed finds several well-gnawed humanoid bones mixed in with the palm fronds.

#### 8 - First Mate's Cabin 
> The smashed wreckage of a bed, dresser, and desk covers the floor of this room. Thick webs extend from floor to ceiling, making it impossible to clearly see the walls beyond. Hundreds of tiny spiders move through the webs.

All parts of this room are engulfed in sheets of webs. The cabin contains nothing of interest, and the spiders pose no threat.

#### 9 - Spider Chambers
> This room is filled with smashed furniture, crushed wooden boxes, and other debris, all covered with thick layers of spiderwebs.

When the door to either of these web-filled rooms is opened, hundreds of tiny spiders scuttle for cover. These areas contain nothing of interest.

#### 10 - Unholy Shrine 
> The floor of this chamber is covered with runes written in blood. A circle has been carved into the floor’s wooden planks and spiderwebs cover the walls and ceiling. Two humanoid-sized bundles attached to the ceiling writhe as hundreds of tiny spiders swarm over them.

[Krell Grohlg](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/319295-krell-grohlg), the last survivor of the cultists who escaped the island, sequestered himself here after the first octopus attack. He attacks at the first sign of intruders — if dying for Lolth is to be his fate, he seeks to slay as many characters as possible

In addition to Krell, this cabin also contains two [giant spiders](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775821-giant-spider) lurking in a far corner, and Krell’s pet [phase spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195158-phase-spider) (named Roil). Unless the characters were unusually quiet while making their way through the ship, Krell has heard them moving and fighting monsters in other areas. Before the fight begins, he has time to cast [shillelagh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2249-shillelagh) on the quarterstaff he wields, [barkskin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2011-barkskin) for defense, and [produce flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2217-produce-flame) in preparation for a confrontation.

The phase spider spends its time in the Border Ethereal. It attempts to ambush Krell’s foes, moving through walls unnoticed before entering the Material Plane to attack a wizard, sorcerer, or similarly vulnerable character. The two giant spiders try to protect Krell. One fights from the ground, while the other clings to the ceiling and attacks downward, enabling both Large creatures to remain in the fray.

**_Ending Hostilities._** Krell knows that the _Emperor_ won’t stay afloat forever. He can be persuaded to leave with the characters instead of fighting them if someone in the party succeeds on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to win the druid’s confidence. An orc or half-orc character makes this check with advantage. Once Krell is safe he slips away to continue his foul worship.

**_Treasure._** All the cultists’ ceremonial objects and treasure are stored in a wooden box along the port wall. The box contains spell scrolls of [gust of wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2134-gust-of-wind) and [protection from poison](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2222-protection-from-poison), a [potion of heroism](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4709-potion-of-heroism), a [potion of water breathing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4715-potion-of-water-breathing), a [cloak of protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4607-cloak-of-protection), 707 gp, and 199 sp.

#### 11 - Galley (Kitchen)
The door here is damaged and held shut by rusty iron spikes. It must be forced open with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check or chopped apart (AC 15, 12 hit points, immunity to psychic and poison damage).

> Judging from the stove along one wall of this room, this was once the galley. Now the area is cluttered with bones and debris. Badly damaged metal knives and other cookware hang from hooks in the ceiling, while the choking stench of rotting flesh fills the air. A stairway leads up near the stern. Tiny spiders crawl over everything.

The cultists kept this area free of webs and used it for food storage. Then, after their supplies ran low, several of them barricaded themselves in this room to seize control of the remaining supplies. In response, the rest of the cultists stormed the area, slew the rebels, and added their corpses to the ship’s larder. All that’s left now of all the rebels are scraps, as the lone survivor (Krell) has consumed the last of them.

**_Trapdoor._** A moldy trapdoor in this area leads down into the cargo hold. It can be easily spotted (no check required). A bar has been inserted through a set of rusted brackets to keep it shut. The cultists used this door to deliver sacrifices to the ghasts below, and they kept it barred between those times to prevent the undead from escaping.

#### 12 - Cargo Hold
> This deck runs the length of the ship and features no bulkheads or walls. Dark, murky seawater fills it to a depth of three feet, sloshing against old, moldering crates piled against the ship’s port hull.

The water that fills this area is difficult terrain for Medium characters. Small characters must swim while in the cargo hold.

This deck is a prison for four [ghasts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16870-ghast) — formerly a group of thieves who stowed away in the hold before the _Emperor_ last left port. When the ship was waylaid by the storm, they could not escape from the hold and eventually starved to death. The cultists found the undead when they took control of the ship but viewed them as emissaries of their dark god and fed them with offerings of living sacrifices.

The ghasts currently hide in the bow of the hold, beneath the water. They won’t reveal themselves until characters enter this area and approach their position, whereupon the undead surge out of the water. Any character whose passive Perception score is 11 or lower is surprised by the ghasts when they attack. A creature paralyzed by a ghast’s claws holds its breath automatically if it collapses into the water, but is at risk of drowning unless it is pulled out again. See “Suffocating."

**_Treasure._** One of the ghasts wears a silver bracelet sculpted to look like a twisted tongue (75 gp), and another one wears a gem-studded belt (400 gp). The crates and boxes are rotted, and the goods in them are worthless — with one exception.

**_Aubreck’s Box._** As an action, a character can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a crate marked with a stylized letter _A_. Another action is required to open it, revealing the box inside.

The blue metal box is made from magically enhanced iron that is impervious to rust and has invulnerability to all damage. It has no lock or latch, and it can’t be opened by any normal means. See [[Salvage Operation]] for details on carrying the box after the elder octopus attacks, and for getting the treasure safely off _Emperor of the Waves_.
