## Overview 

Seabrook Island is a small, windswept island just off the coast. No permanent settlement has ever taken hold, and aside from the occasional fisherman beaching a skiff, the island is largely ignored.

The island’s most striking features are two enormous standing stones, weathered by salt and time. They loom above the island like broken teeth, carved with faded runes that no longer match any commonly known script. Locals avoid the stones, preferring to leave offerings of shells or driftwood at a distance rather than approach them directly.

Among Seabrook’s fishermen, a persistent rumor claims that long ago a siren was chained to the stones and sacrificed by an ancient human tribe as an offering to the sea. According to the tale, her spirit was bound within the runestones, and her song still echoes faintly through the world, drawing fish into the surrounding waters. Many credit this legend for the region’s unusually reliable fishing, and a few swear they have heard music on the wind during heavy fog.

In truth, the standing stones are not a grave or a curse, but something far older and more deliberate. They are an Echogate, an ancient teleportation structure once used to traverse great distances instantly. The runes etched into the stones are arcane in nature, though badly eroded and partially dormant. [[Keledek]] recognizes the stones for what they are and believes they were once part of a wider network scattered across the Endor Forest and beyond.
