## Overview 

Old Seabrook occupies the northern bank of the [[Roaring Brook River]] and represents the older, quieter heart of the town. Where South Seabrook buzzes with docks, markets, and constant traffic, Old Seabrook feels  shaped more by memory of what [[Seabrook]] once was.

The district is sparsely populated, with wider streets, older stonework, and buildings that show their age without apology. Many structures here date back to Seabrook’s early years, and some have outlived the families who built them. This side of the river tends to attract those who value privacy, tradition, or simply distance from the noise of the docks.

Old Seabrook is home to several of the town’s civic and somber institutions, including the cemetery, the jail, and the watchtower. A handful of businesses and taverns operate in the district, catering mostly to locals, guards, and those with reason to avoid the crowds across the river. These establishments are quieter, more reserved, and often serve as places where long memories and old grudges linger.

Notably, Old Seabrook is where [[Drallion Mansion]] stands, now the property of the Seaward Milkmen. The mansion’s presence adds a subtle shift to the district’s character, marking it as a place where the past and future of Seabrook are beginning to intersect once more.
