## Overview 

South Seabrook is the beating heart of the town, crowded, noisy, and constantly in motion. Built along the southern bank of the [[Roaring Brook River]] and spilling out toward the docks and open water, this district is where Seabrook eats, drinks, trades, argues, and survives.

The streets here are densely packed and often chaotic. Buildings lean close together, wooden walkways creak under constant foot traffic, and the smell of salt, fish, tar, smoke, and spilled ale never truly fades. Sailors, merchants, laborers, travelers, and opportunists intermingle at all hours, and it is rare to walk a block without hearing an argument, a sales pitch, or a half-finished sea shanty.

South Seabrook contains most of the town’s taverns, inns, shops, and guild halls, including places like the [[Mariners' Guildhall (Seabrook)]] and popular drinking holes such as the [[Empty Net]]. Information flows freely here, though truth is often buried beneath rumor, exaggeration, and self-interest.
