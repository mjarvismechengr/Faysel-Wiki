## Overview 

Valenreach County occupies the western half of the [[Duchy of Valorden]], stretching along the [[Siren Coast]] and encompassing some of the most politically and economically significant territory in the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. Its lands include dense port infrastructure, reclaimed marshes, and major river mouths, as well as [[Taunden Isle]], a large and strategically vital island just off the coast. The county also contains the city of [[Independence]], making Valenreach inseparable from the administration of the realm itself.

During the [[War of the Fractured Crown]], Valenreach was ruled by [[House Velmor]] under Count [[Darius Velmor]]. Bound by vassal loyalty to Duke [[Aren Varnis]], Velmor aligned with the rebellion reluctantly and without conviction. The county’s participation was cautious and limited, motivated more by obligation than ideology. When the tide turned decisively in the Crown’s favor, House Velmor surrendered early and without resistance.

That decision spared the house destruction. Valenreach retained its comital line, but under consequence. In the war’s aftermath, House Velmor was placed under Church oversight, its finances audited and its authority curtailed. Political ambition was sharply constrained, and the county became a model of controlled compliance rather than influence.

Today, Valenreach is prosperous, orderly, and deliberately restrained. Trade flows steadily through its ports, administration functions efficiently, and public loyalty to the Crown is visible and consistent. At the same time, the county’s proximity to Independence ensures constant scrutiny. Nothing of significance here escapes royal or ecclesiastical notice.
