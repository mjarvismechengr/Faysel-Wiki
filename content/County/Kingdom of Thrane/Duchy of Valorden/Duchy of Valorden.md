## Overview 

The Duchy of Valorden occupies the northern reaches of the [[West Marsh]] within the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. It is a fertile and heavily settled region shaped by slow rivers, reclaimed wetlands, and low, grassy hills that rise gently from the marsh. The most notable of these uplands are the [[Wyrmrest Knolls]], a band of ancient hills that break the flatness of the marsh and mark the duchy’s eastern interior.

Geographically, Valorden is divided as much by culture as by land. The western half of the duchy faces the [[Siren Coast]], where managed waterways, ports, and sea trade dominate daily life. This region includes the great city of [[Independence]], the political and administrative heart of the kingdom, as well as [[Taunden Isle]], a large and strategically important island just off the coast. The eastern half of Valorden is quieter and more rural, defined by open lowlands, the Wyrmrest Knolls, and long-established noble estates.

Despite its wealth and position, Valorden is remembered first for its rebellion. Roughly twenty-five years ago, the duchy was the epicenter of the [[War of the Fractured Crown]], when Duke [[Aren Varnis]] led a coalition of nobles against the early reforms of King [[Lytharion Solmara]]. The rebellion was defeated decisively. [[House Varnis]] was extinguished, its lands seized, and Valorden placed under direct royal occupation for five years. Order returned quickly. Trust did not.

[[House Bewne]] was installed afterward as the new ducal line, charged with reconstruction. Duchess [[Herenya Bewne]] rules as a patron of reform and stability, and is widely regarded as the King’s most trusted ducal ally. Her governance emphasizes transparency, cooperation with the Crown and Church, and careful management of noble ambition. Under her rule, Valorden has become outwardly orderly and productive, if quietly wary.

The duchy is divided into two primary vassal counties. [[Valenreach County]] governs the western coast and urban centers, including Independence and Taunden Isle, and is oriented toward trade, administration, and maritime power. [[Highvale County]] controls the eastern interior, including the Wyrmrest Knolls, and is more traditional in character. It was within Highvale that much of the noble unrest leading to the rebellion first took root, a fact that still colors its reputation.
