## Overview 

Highvale County lies in the eastern half of the [[Duchy of Valorden]], stretching across open lowlands and the western slopes of the [[Wyrmrest Knolls]]. Compared to Valorden’s coastal west, Highvale is quieter and more traditional, shaped by pasture, grain fields, and long-established estates rather than ports or canals.

The county is ruled by Countess [[Laryn Hest]], head of [[House Hest]]. Unlike many of Valorden’s older noble families, House Hest rose from mercantile origins rather than inherited lordship. During the [[War of the Fractured Crown]], the Hests provided critical financial backing to King [[Lytharion Solmara]], funding troop levies, supplies, and reconstruction when royal resources were strained. Their elevation to comital rank was a calculated decision by the Crown, rewarding loyalty and competence over lineage.

Highvale’s lands were the primary staging ground of the rebellion, and its people have not forgotten that loss. Estates were seized, lineages extinguished, and traditions broken in ways that still shape local memory. Though the war ended a generation ago, resentment lingers beneath the surface, passed down through family stories, half-spoken grievances, and a persistent sense that Valorden’s fate was decided elsewhere.

House Hest was elevated after the war as part of the duchy’s reorganization, chosen for reliability rather than legacy. While the house itself did not participate in the uprising, its appointment remains divisive. Some view the Hests as stabilizing stewards who prevented further punishment. Others see them as beneficiaries of defeat, rewarded for loyalty to a crown that crushed local power. Acceptance has grown with time, but it is uneven and often conditional.

Politically, Highvale is fractured but contained. Open defiance is rare, yet enthusiasm for reform is muted. Public order is strong, but loyalty is often procedural rather than heartfelt. The Hests govern carefully, balancing enforcement with restraint, aware that stability here depends less on law alone than on allowing old anger to fade naturally.
