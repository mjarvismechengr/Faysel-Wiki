## Overview 

Timber County occupies the eastern half of the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]], where the [[Endor Forest]] begins to thin and give way to the settled interior of the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]. It is a land of tall conifers, cold streams, and gradual clearings, less marshbound than the western county and more deeply shaped by the rhythms of logging, travel, and frontier defense. The forest here is still ancient, but it feels managed rather than encroaching, marked by old cuts, watch roads, and long-standing settlements carved carefully from the trees.

The [[Eldhollow Road]] continues eastward through Timber County, following the river upstream toward its source. This stretch of road is narrower and more exposed than its western counterpart, passing through long corridors of forest where visibility is limited and distance between settlements grows wider. Control of the road remains essential, as it carries goods, timber, and travelers between Vaelwyth and the rest of Thrane. In winter and during heavy rains, it may be the only reliable route through the region.

Near the river’s upper reaches lies [[Mithcreek]], a settlement built around the Eldhollow’s source waters and the hills full of mithral. The surrounding land is rich in timber and game, and the creek itself provides clear, fast-moving water that supports mills and river traffic downstream. Mithcreek anchors the interior of the county and supplies much of the wood and raw materials that move west toward the coast.

Farther east, at the forest’s edge, stands [[Havengarde]], Timber County’s administrative center. Positioned where the forest gives way to open land, Havengarde serves as the county’s final bastion before the wilderness and its first line of defense against threats moving inward. The town’s location makes it a natural gathering point for patrols, caravans, and travelers transitioning between frontier and heartland.

Life in Timber County is shaped by distance and responsibility. Settlements are fewer and more self-reliant, roads are guarded because neglect invites disaster, and the forest is treated with wary respect rather than fear. The county lacks the commercial traffic of the coast or the visibility of the western gate, but its role is no less important. Timber County ensures that Vaelwyth’s eastern border holds, that the forest does not reclaim what has been won, and that the frontier remains firmly within Thrane’s grasp.
