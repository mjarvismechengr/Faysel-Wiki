## Overview 

The Duchy of Vaelwyth occupies the [[Kingdom of Thrane]]’s northwestern frontier, where the southern reaches of the [[Endor Forest]] meet the settled lands of the kingdom. It is a region defined by ancient woodland, narrow river valleys, and a fogbound coastline along the [[Siren Sea]]. Vaelwyth does not present a clear boundary between civilization and wilderness so much as a constant negotiation between the two, with settlements carved carefully from a forest that has never truly receded.

The northern border of the duchy follows the [[Eldhollow River]] and the [[Eldhollow Road]] running beside it, forming the practical edge of Thrane’s authority in this part of the world. Beyond that line, the forest deepens and order becomes uncertain. To the west, Vaelwyth’s reach extends into the Siren Sea through a scattering of coastal islands, important for controlling trade routes and limiting smuggling along the forested shore. To the east and south, the duchy ends where the forest thins and cultivated land gives way to the interior duchies of Thrane.

Vaelwyth is not among the kingdom’s wealthiest regions, but it is among the most demanding to govern. The forest shelters bandits, raiders, and creatures that make travel dangerous and isolation common. As a result, authority in Vaelwyth is practical and visibly enforced. Roads are maintained because they must be. Law is respected because it is consistently applied. Stability here is measured not in prosperity, but in the absence of disaster.

During the [[War of the Fractured Crown]], Vaelwyth did not become a battlefield, but its role was no less significant. Its position along the [[Duchy of Valorden]]’s northern edge and its ability to remain secure prevented the rebellion from spreading into the frontier. The duchy’s conduct during the conflict reinforced its reputation as a dependable bulwark of the Crown, capable of containing unrest rather than contributing to it.

Vaelwyth’s importance is further shaped by its relationship with power beyond the purely political. Deep within the duchy lies [[Liberty]], home to [[Chasmkeep]], the greatest centers of magical learning in the world. The presence of such an institution has made Vaelwyth accustomed to arcane influence, powerful scholars, and disputes that cannot be resolved by force alone. The duchy’s identity reflects this balance, blending frontier vigilance with a long familiarity with magic, knowledge, and authority that does not originate from noble blood.
