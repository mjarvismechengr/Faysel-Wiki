## Overview 

Eldhollow County occupies the western half of the [[Duchy of Vaelwyth]], stretching from the interior forest to the fog-laced coast of the [[Siren Sea]]. It is defined by water and woodland, shaped by the slow course of the [[Eldhollow River]] as it winds westward through the forest before emptying into the sea. The land here is damp, fertile in places, and perpetually shadowed, where mist rises easily from riverbanks and marshes and the forest never feels far away.

The county takes its name from the Eldhollow River, which serves as both lifeline and boundary. Near its western mouth, the river spreads and slows, feeding the wetlands that give rise to the [[Black Bog]], a vast and treacherous marsh lying just inland within the forest. These boglands are impassable in large stretches and have long shaped travel, settlement, and defense in the region. Roads skirt their edges, villages cling to firmer ground, and the river itself becomes the safest route through much of the county.

At the river’s mouth lies [[Marshfield]], the county’s administrative center. The town is named for the surrounding wetlands and occupies a critical position where river, road, and coast converge. Marshfield sits along the [[Shepherd's Highway]], the main north south route that carries trade, travelers, and military traffic along the forested coastline. For merchants entering Thrane from the north or leaving it by land, Marshfield is the first and last major point of oversight, making it one of the most important customs and trade hubs in the frontier duchies.

From Marshfield, the [[Eldhollow Road]] runs eastward along the river into the heart of the forest, linking the coast to [[Liberty]] and other inland settlements. This route is vital but vulnerable, passing through long stretches of dense woodland and marsh-fed lowlands where visibility is poor and danger is common. Control of this road is central to the county’s importance, as it governs movement between the coast, the interior forest, and the rest of Thrane.

Beyond Marshfield, the county includes scattered coastal villages, forest hamlets, and roadside settlements that exist to support trade, logging, fishing, and travel. Life in Eldhollow County is shaped by proximity to the wild. The forest presses close to cleared land, and the bogs resist every attempt at full reclamation. As a result, the county has developed a reputation for vigilance and pragmatism, valuing secure roads and steady governance over expansion or display.
