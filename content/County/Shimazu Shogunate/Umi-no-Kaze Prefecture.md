## Overview 

Umi-no-Kaze Prefecture (海の風州) occupies the northernmost island of [[Yoseju]], a wind-scoured land shaped by cold seas, pristine forests, and picturesque mountain springs. The prefecture forms a loose crescent north of the [[Koganumi Strait]], its shores wrapping around the narrow channel that separates it from the southern islands. Though distant from the political heart of the shogunate, Umi-no-Kaze lies closer than any other settled land to the front of the holy war beyond Yoseju’s borders.

The island’s geography is defined by exposure and constraint. [[Kodokuna Mountain]] dominates the southern end of the prefecture, its slopes descending sharply toward the western coast near [[Kaminari]]. A smaller, older peak rises near the northern reaches, overlooking the beaches and cliffs around [[Mokodoya]]. Between these heights, forests and rolling hills give way to narrow valleys and wind-flattened plains where settlements cling to defensible ground. A smaller island sits within the open curve of the prefecture’s shape, sheltering the strait and softening the impact of storms rolling in from the open sea.

Authority in Umi-no-Kaze is centered at [[Omi Village]], located on the southern foot of [[Wakimizu Mountain]], just north of the island’s midpoint. From here, [[Clan Sakai]] governs through presence rather than spectacle. Roads are maintained to allow the rapid movement of troops and supplies. Watchtowers rise along the coast and on high ground, not as symbols of power, but as necessities. Villages are built to endure wind, salt, and isolation, favoring durability over ornament or grandeur.

The northern coast, particularly around Mokodoya, marks the practical edge of the shogunate’s reach. While often described as a military outpost, Mokodoya remains primarily a village. Its people fish, trade, raise families, and bury their dead while living under the constant awareness of threat from beyond the sea. Raids from the north are a known danger rather than an unending catastrophe, and the population has adapted to live alongside that reality rather than exist solely in response to it.

Despite its remoteness, Umi-no-Kaze holds significant strategic value. Control of the Koganumi Strait allows the shogunate to regulate movement between the northern and southern islands, while the prefecture’s coastline serves as Yoseju’s first warning against invasion. Forces stationed here can be redeployed quickly by sea, making the region a critical point of transition between defense and response during times of crisis.

Umi-no-Kaze is not a land of ceremony or political maneuvering. Its importance lies in what it absorbs rather than what it projects. Storms, invasions, and the distant violence of holy war break here first, sparing the interior islands their full force. The prefecture’s identity reflects this burden. It is restrained, disciplined, and quietly resolute, standing watch so the rest of the realm does not have to.
