## Overview 

The Nine Hells are a plane of tyranny, punishment, and ruthless order. Unlike the chaos of the [[Abyss]], the Nine Hells are meticulously structured, governed by hierarchy, law, and binding agreements. Every layer, every soul, and every act of suffering serves a purpose within an immense and ancient system of control.

The plane is divided into nine descending layers, each ruled by powerful archdevils whose authority is maintained through contracts, fear, and absolute obedience. Advancement in the Nine Hells is possible, but always earned through cruelty, manipulation, or unwavering loyalty to infernal law. Failure is punished without mercy.

Devils are the primary inhabitants of the Nine Hells and embody calculated malice. They are patient, intelligent, and deeply invested in long-term schemes. Where demons seek destruction for its own sake, devils seek domination through inevitability. They corrupt not by force alone, but by offering solutions that come with carefully hidden costs.

Mortal souls are a prized resource within the Nine Hells. Those who enter through infernal bargains, broken oaths, or certain paths of damnation are bound into the infernal hierarchy, often reshaped into lesser devils. The suffering of these souls fuels the power structures of the plane and reinforces its endless machinery.

In [[Faysel]]’s cosmology, the Nine Hells represent the perversion of order. They prove that law without mercy can be as destructive as chaos without restraint. Though devils are bound by rules, those rules exist solely to entrap, ensuring that once a soul falls under infernal claim, escape is nearly impossible. 

[[Asmodeus]], is recognized as the supreme ruler of the Nine Hells. From the deepest layer, he oversees the infernal hierarchy with absolute authority, setting the laws that bind devils and define their endless schemes. Though he rarely acts openly, every contract, promotion, and punishment ultimately serves his will. To many scholars and theologians, the Nine Hells are not merely his domain, but an extension of his divine philosophy, a system perfected to harvest souls through consent, obligation, and inevitability.
