## Overview 

The Abyss is a plane of chaos, corruption, and endless hunger. It is not governed by natural law or stable reality, but by violence, desire, and the constant drive to consume and dominate. The Abyss has no true center or edge, only an infinite descent of shifting layers shaped by the will of powerful fiends and the collective malice of the plane itself.

Reality within the Abyss is unstable and hostile. Landscapes warp without warning, environments react to emotion and bloodshed, and survival often depends on cruelty or submission. The plane actively resists order, punishing attempts to impose structure or restraint.

The Abyss is home to demons and other entities born from chaos and hatred. These beings are not unified by loyalty, but by shared appetite. Alliances are temporary, betrayal is inevitable, and power is measured only by the ability to destroy and endure. Even the strongest demon lords rule through constant violence, knowing their reigns are never secure.

Corruption is the Abyss’s most insidious weapon. Prolonged exposure erodes morality, amplifies base impulses, and twists both body and mind. Mortals touched by the Abyss often carry lasting scars, including physical mutations, warped desires, or an overwhelming urge toward destruction.

In [[Faysel]]’s cosmology, the Abyss stands in direct opposition to balance and continuity. It does not seek to rule the world so much as to unravel it. When its influence reaches the Material Plane, it does so through cult activity, planar breaches, or artifacts steeped in chaos, each leaving devastation long after the initial contact ends.
