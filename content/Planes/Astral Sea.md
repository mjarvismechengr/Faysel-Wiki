## Overview 

The Astral Sea is the vast expanse that connects the planes of existence. It is not a place of land or sky, but of endless void where thought, memory, and spirit drift unbound by physical law. Travel through the Astral Sea is less a matter of distance and more a matter of intent.

Time does not function normally within the Astral Sea. Creatures do not age, hunger, or tire while within it, and moments can feel simultaneous rather than sequential. Because of this, the Astral Sea serves as a crossroads for planar travelers, divine messengers, and lost souls caught between destinations.

Fragments of dead gods, forgotten realms, and abandoned constructs float through the Astral Sea like islands. These remnants are echoes of past ages, many dating back to the time before [[the Sundering]]. Some are inert and silent, while others still pulse with residual power or trapped consciousness.

The Astral Sea borders the realms of the gods and the outer planes, though access is neither simple nor safe. Powerful entities patrol or lurk within it, and travelers risk becoming unmoored from their bodies if their focus falters. Astral projection, divine intervention, and certain ancient artifacts allow passage through this plane, but all require great care.

In[[Faysel]]’s cosmology, the Astral Sea represents transition rather than destination. It is the space between choices, the pause between life and afterlife, and the medium through which divine influence once flowed freely. Though the gods have withdrawn, the Astral Sea remains, filled with silent witnesses to what was and what may yet return.
