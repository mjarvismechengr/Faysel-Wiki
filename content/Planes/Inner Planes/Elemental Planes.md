## Overview 

The Elemental Planes are the primal foundations of reality, composed of raw matter and energy in their purest forms. Fire, Water, Earth, and Air exist here unbound by the constraints of the Material Plane, forming vast and often hostile realms where elemental forces dominate all else. These planes predate mortal civilizations and were shaped during the earliest moments of creation.

Each elemental plane embodies its nature completely. Landscapes are extreme and absolute, with little regard for mortal survival. Oceans have no shore, mountains stretch endlessly without sky, storms never fully dissipate, and flames burn without fuel. Native creatures are formed from the substance of their plane and thrive in conditions that would destroy most outsiders.

Though distinct, the Elemental Planes are not entirely separate. At their boundaries, elemental forces mingle, creating unstable border regions where matter behaves unpredictably. These liminal spaces are believed to influence unusual natural phenomena within the Material Plane, including perpetual storms, volcanic regions, shifting deserts, and living stone.

The Elemental Planes exert constant pressure on the Material Plane, though usually in subtle ways. Elemental magic, natural disasters, and certain summoned creatures draw power directly from these realms. Prolonged imbalance or forced intrusion can lead to catastrophic consequences, reshaping landscapes or unleashing destructive forces beyond mortal control.

To mortals, the Elemental Planes represent creation without restraint. They are neither good nor evil, but indifferent, embodying the raw mechanisms that make the world possible. Those who seek power from them do so at great risk, for the elements do not negotiate, remember, or forgive.
