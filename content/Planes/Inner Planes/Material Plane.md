## Overview 

The Material Plane is the primary plane of existence in Faysel and the home of mortals, nations, and history. It is the plane where physical reality holds the greatest sway, governed by natural laws, time, and consequence. Most creatures are born here, live here, and leave their mark here, whether through conquest, creation, or quiet persistence.

The Material Plane contains the planet [[Faysel]], with all known continents, seas, and skies of Faysel, as well as countless hidden places lost to time. Ruins of fallen empires, sealed horrors, and dormant relics lie buried beneath cities and wilderness alike. Though the plane appears stable, its history reveals repeated cycles of growth, collapse, and rebirth. Planar boundaries are strongest here, yet they are not absolute. Certain locations, rituals, and artifacts allow passage to other planes, often at great risk.
