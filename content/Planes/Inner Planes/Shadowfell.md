## Overview 

The Shadowfell is a plane of gloom and decay that exists as a dark reflection of the Material Plane. It mirrors the world of [[Faysel]] in shape and structure, but everything within it is muted, twisted, or diminished, as if reality itself has begun to forget why it exists. Light is weak, colors are washed thin, and hope feels distant even when it is present.

This plane is deeply tied to death, loss, and unresolved emotion. Souls may pass near or through the Shadowfell on their journey to the afterlife, and some become trapped by regret, obsession, or unfinished purpose. Time behaves strangely here, often stretching moments of suffering or freezing places in long stagnation.

The Shadowfell is home to the Domains of Dread, isolated realms ruled by powerful and cursed entities known as dark lords. These domains function as prisons shaped by the sins, fears, and failures of their rulers. Though each domain is unique, all share the same oppressive atmosphere and cruel irony, ensuring that power never brings peace.

Ancient evils, undead powers, and forgotten gods find refuge or captivity within the Shadowfell. Necromancy draws heavily from this plane, and prolonged exposure can numb emotion, drain vitality, or alter one’s sense of self. Travelers who remain too long often report growing detachment from the living world.

Despite its darkness, the Shadowfell is not purely evil. It is a necessary part of the cosmic balance, a place where endings linger and memories refuse to fade. It preserves what the world cannot release, for better or worse. Those who enter it willingly do so seeking forbidden knowledge, lost souls, or power born of suffering, rarely without consequence.
