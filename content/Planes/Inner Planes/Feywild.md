## Overview 

The Feywild is a vibrant, untamed reflection of the [[Material Plane]], shaped by emotion, instinct, and ancient magic. Where the [[Shadowfell]] drains color and warmth, the Feywild magnifies them. Forests grow impossibly tall, rivers gleam with inner light, and landscapes shift with mood, season, or whim.

Time and logic are unreliable within the Feywild. Days may pass in moments or stretch into years, and travelers often return to the Material Plane long after they believe they have left. Cause and effect are fluid, and promises carry weight beyond simple words. Bargains, favors, and insults are remembered with unsettling clarity.

The plane is home to powerful fey beings ranging from mischievous sprites to ancient archfey whose domains reflect their personalities. Courts rise and fall with the seasons, and feuds may last centuries over slights mortals would consider trivial. Beauty and cruelty coexist freely, often indistinguishable until it is too late.

Magic is abundant in the Feywild and seeps into every aspect of existence. Emotions run stronger, creativity flourishes, and desires are harder to suppress. While the plane can be wondrous and inspiring, it is also dangerous to the unprepared. Fey creatures rarely act out of malice, but their morality does not align with mortal expectations.

Though the Feywild touches the Material Plane in many places, these crossings are unstable and often hidden. Rings of mushrooms, ancient groves, and sites of powerful emotion may serve as gateways. Mortals who wander into the Feywild often return changed, carrying strange gifts, lingering curses, or memories that feel more like dreams than lived experience.
