## Overview

Iskandar is a force of nature, embodying the vast and unknowable aspects of the world. He is the god of storms, seas, mystery, and those who are lost or forgotten. Where others represent cycles, law, or renewal, Iskandar governs what lies beyond certainty, the depths that cannot be fully charted and the skies that conceal more than they reveal.

Though often associated with destruction, Iskandar is equally a giver. The sea feeds as often as it drowns. Storms cleanse even as they ruin. He accepts that creation and destruction are inseparable, and that life persists not in spite of loss, but alongside it. His nature is neither cruel nor merciful, but honest.

Iskandar is contemplative and boisterous in equal measure. At times he is loud, laughing thunderously and sharing freely with those around him. At others he is distant and silent, watching from behind clouds or beneath the waves. He reminds mortals that not all truths are meant to be known, and not all that is lost is gone forever. He watches over those forgotten by the world, especially sailors, wanderers, and souls cast loose by circumstance. In the heart of the fiercest storm, he teaches that despair is not the end, but the prelude to renewal.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Iskandar is depicted as a being of immense and terrifying beauty, his form a union of ocean and storm. His hair falls like rolling waves, and his eyes churn with unfathomable depth, reflecting both sky and sea. His voice carries the weight of ancient waters, sometimes booming with laughter, other times quiet as a coming squall.

He is often shown wielding High Tide, a harpoon forged by [[Cyra]] from [[tyrite]] and kraken bone, and sailing across the world aboard his ship, The [[Typhoon]]. Artists struggle to capture him consistently, portraying him sometimes as a towering figure looming over the horizon, and other times as a companionable giant sharing food, drink, and stories with mortals. Often these contradictions are intentional. Devotees say that any single depiction of Iskandar is incomplete, for the sea itself cannot be captured in one moment.

## Goals

Iskandar does not seek change for its own sake, nor does he strive to preserve the world as it is. His goal is balance through honesty. He ensures that the vast, dangerous, and unknowable parts of existence are not denied or forgotten.

He watches over those who drift, whether across oceans or through life itself. Sailors, wanderers, outcasts, and the forgotten dead often call to him, not for safety, but for direction or meaning. Iskandar does not always answer with rescue. Sometimes he answers with endurance.

Iskandar opposes stagnation only when it denies reality. Empires that pretend permanence, people who believe themselves beyond loss, and powers that seek total control over nature often earn his ire. Storms rise not to punish, but to remind.

## Relationships

Iskandar is the son of Calypso and Castor, and the twin brother of Solara. From Calypso he inherits an acceptance of inevitability and change. From Castor he gains empathy for the lost and a watchful presence over those who wander. Where his parents observe cycles and paths, Iskandar lives within them, embodying the moments when direction is unclear and forces collide.

His relationship with Solara is one of affectionate rivalry and deep trust. They are opposites by nature but complements by function. Solara brings clarity, warmth, and action, while Iskandar brings uncertainty, motion, and endurance. Their followers often clash philosophically, but myths frequently place the two side by side, storm giving way to sunlight, fire riding the winds. Neither seeks dominance over the other, and both recognize that the world needs them in equal measure.

Iskandar shares a close bond with Castor and often acts as the means through which his father’s quiet guidance becomes tangible. Where Castor watches from afar, Iskandar intervenes directly, steering ships, breaking storms, or guiding the lost through sheer force of presence. Though more impulsive than his father, he honors Castor’s patience and sense of responsibility.

He respects Cyrus, though not without tension. Iskandar believes in justice, but is skeptical of rigid law. The sea does not obey rules, and storms do not wait for verdicts. Still, he acknowledges Cyrus as a necessary counterweight to chaos, and their relationship is marked by mutual respect rather than agreement.

Iskandar finds a kindred spirit and rival in Rodikar. Both thrive in struggle, competition, and moments where victory must be seized rather than negotiated. Where Rodikar seeks conquest and dominance, Iskandar seeks survival and passage. Their contests are legendary, sometimes martial, sometimes competitive feats of endurance, and often end in laughter, bruises, and shared drink rather than bloodshed.

He is famously close with Thalia, with whom he shares a love of excess, storytelling, and living fully in the moment. Storm festivals, sea shanties, drunken vows, and wild celebrations are often attributed to their shared influence. Where Thalia celebrates joy for its own sake, Iskandar celebrates it as defiance against despair.

Iskandar’s relationship with Xalzotec is uneasy and layered. Both claim dominion over the unknown and the unseen, but where Xalzotec hoards secrets and feeds on fear, Iskandar represents mystery without malice. The depths of the sea and the obscurity of storms conceal truths, but they do not demand blood in exchange for them. This overlap makes them wary of one another, neither allies nor direct enemies.

He holds little patience for Asmodeus’s calculated cruelty and views infernal bargains as an insult to the honest danger of the world. Storms do not lie about their intent. Contracts that disguise damnation offend him more than outright violence.

Among the pantheon, Iskandar is neither a planner nor a tyrant. He is the god who arrives when maps fail and certainty collapses. To some gods, he is reckless. To others, unreliable. But to sailors, wanderers, and those standing at the edge of the known world, Iskandar is proof that being lost does not mean being abandoned.

## Myth and History

A beloved tale among sailors tells of two mysterious boatmen who rescue the lost at sea. One, missing an eye, quietly tends the wounded and sets a course by the stars. The other is loud, warm, and larger than life, steering the vessel through calmed waters while raising spirits. The sky clears, fish are shared, and the ship arrives safely, often somewhere the passengers did not know they needed to be. Many believe this story recounts Castor sailing alongside his son Iskandar.

Another legend tells of Iskandar sailing The Typhoon across all four oceans to battle a colossal leviathan. Their clash birthed a storm unmatched in memory. With a final throw, Iskandar cast High Tide, striking the killing blow and pinning the beast to the ocean floor. The harpoon is said to remain there still, resting in the deep, waiting for the sea to call upon it again.
