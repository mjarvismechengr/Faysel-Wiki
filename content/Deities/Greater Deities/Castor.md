## Overview

Castor teaches that the wisdom of the cosmos is meant to guide those who seek it. He is the god of the moon, stars, travelers, vigilance, and quiet understanding, watching over the world from above with a patient and unblinking eye. His teachings emphasize exploration, discovery, and reflection beneath the night sky, where answers are found not through force, but through observation and perseverance.

Castor is benevolent and protective toward the people of Faysel, particularly those who journey into the unknown. He does not promise safety, but guidance, believing that hardship is an essential teacher. To walk under Castor’s watch is to accept uncertainty while trusting that the path forward can be found.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Castor is commonly depicted as a venerable and kindly figure with a flowing silver beard that glimmers like starlight. One of his eyes is a deep pool of cosmic wisdom, while the other is missing, sacrificed long ago. He wears robes said to be woven from the night sky itself, embroidered with constellations that subtly shift between tellings.

He carries a shepherd’s crook, its curved head shaped like a crescent moon, symbolizing guidance. In many depictions he is shown calmly smoking a pipe, reinforcing his association with patience, contemplation, and unhurried wisdom. Those who encounter him in myth often remark on the sense of safety he brings, a reassurance that even in darkness, one is not alone.

## Goals

Castor’s foremost goal is to guide rather than rule. He seeks to ensure that knowledge, curiosity, and wisdom remain accessible to mortals willing to look beyond fear and certainty. Where other gods demand devotion or obedience, Castor encourages questioning, exploration, and the pursuit of understanding.

As protector of travelers, he works to ensure that roads, seas, and stars remain navigable, both physically and symbolically. He does not prevent travelers from losing their way, but he ensures that signs, chances, and moments of clarity exist for those who are paying attention.

Castor is deeply invested in vigilance against darkness, not only external threats, but ignorance, complacency, and despair. He believes that evil thrives when people stop watching the horizon or asking questions. In this way, his guidance is subtle but constant, expressed through omens, constellations, and quiet insight rather than miracles.

Though gentle in demeanor, Castor is unwavering in his resolve. He does not abandon the world, even after the Sundering, and continues to observe, guide, and protect, trusting mortals to walk their own paths while keeping his eye upon them.

## Relationships

Castor is said to be the son of Cyra and Cyrus, brother and husband to Calypso, and brother to Asmodeus, Komaku, and Rambak. He is the father of the twin gods Iskandar and Solara.

Castor’s bond with Calypso is one of deep alignment rather than authority or dependence. Where Calypso governs inevitability, cycles, and the turning of fate, Castor concerns himself with awareness within those cycles. He accepts change as necessary, but believes that understanding one’s place within it is what allows mortals to endure without losing themselves. Together, they represent not control over time, but wisdom within it.

He shares strong philosophical alignment with Cyrus, though their methods differ. Cyrus embodies law as structure and enforcement, while Castor embodies law as guidance and vigilance. Where Cyrus stands in judgment, Castor stands watch. Both value order, but Castor is more willing to accept uncertainty so long as it is faced with awareness and care.

Castor is in quiet but fundamental opposition to Asmodeus. He views infernal tyranny as a corruption of order, one that replaces guidance with coercion and vigilance with surveillance. Unlike Solara or Cyrus, Castor does not confront Asmodeus directly. Instead, he resists through endurance, foresight, and the slow work of illumination. He trusts that awareness outlasts manipulation, and that even the most intricate lie eventually falters under sustained watchfulness.

His opposition to Xalzotec is older and more symbolic. Castor placed his eye in the night sky not to banish darkness, but to watch it. He understands that night cannot be destroyed, only endured and navigated. New moons still come, and the moon is no second sun, but its presence reminds mortals that even in darkness, they are not unseen. Where Xalzotec thrives on secrecy and unseen bloodshed, Castor represents vigilance, revelation, and the quiet comfort of being watched over rather than hunted.

Castor maintains a respectful and easy rapport with Rambak. Both value patience, continuity, and the long view of the world. Where Rambak embodies kinship and the living world itself, Castor serves as its witness, remembering paths, stories, and lessons long after individual lives have passed.

His relationship with Manai is one of philosophical contrast rather than open conflict. Manai embodies destruction and accumulation through force, while Castor values endurance, restraint, and the slow gathering of wisdom. Castor does not condemn Manai, but he does not trust him. To Castor, destruction without understanding leaves only silence, not meaning.

Castor’s love for Solara is evident, though their temperaments differ sharply. Where Solara burns bright and demands action, Castor counsels patience and reflection. He does not seek to temper her fire, only to ensure it does not consume more than it must. In Iskandar, he sees both the beauty and danger of the unknown, and accepts that some things must remain beyond sight.

Among the gods, Castor is not the loudest voice, nor the strongest hand. He is the one who watches, remembers, and waits. In a pantheon defined by ambition, wrath, and transformation, Castor stands as the quiet certainty that no path is truly walked alone.

## Myth and History

It is said that Castor plucked out his own eye and placed it in the night sky so that those lost in darkness would always have a light to guide them. This eye became the moon, known as [[Castor's Eye]], ever watching the world below. His blood, cast across the heavens in the act, became the stars and distant galaxies, marking the cosmos with his sacrifice.

Among sailors, a beloved story tells of two mysterious boatmen who appear to those lost at sea. One is missing an eye and tends to the injured while quietly setting a course. The other is boisterous and warm, raising spirits and steering the vessel through calmed waters. The sky clears, fish appear, and the ship arrives safely, often at a destination the passengers did not know they needed. Many believe this tale recounts Castor sailing alongside his son [[Iskandar]], guiding not only ships, but lives.
