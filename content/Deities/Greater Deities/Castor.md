### Depictions in Art and Myth
Castor is often depicted as a venerable and kind figure, with a flowing, silvery beard that shimmers like the night sky. One eye is a deep pool of cosmic wisdom, and is missing the other. He's cloaked in an ethereal robe sewn from the night sky itself, and carries a shepherd's crook with crook in the shape of a crescent moon. Occasionally he's depicted smoking a pipe. He exudes a presence of safety and wondrous enlightenment, sharing wisdom and insights to those he meets.

## Myth and History

- It is said that he plucked out his own eye and placed it in the night sky to be a light for those lost in the dark, which is why the moon is named [[Castor's Eye]]. His blood that sprayed across the heavens became stars and galaxies.

- A common story among sailors is that of two mysterious boatmen happening upon shipwrecked, lost, or stranded souls on the seas. One of the men is missing an eye and tends to the injured while setting a course, the other is boisterous and raises the spirits of his new passengers while helming the ship. The waters seem to miraculously calm and skies clear, fresh caught fish is served to the hungry, and passengers always seem to arrive at destination they didn't even know they needed to be at. It's speculated that it is Castor sailing the seas with his son [[Iskandar]].
