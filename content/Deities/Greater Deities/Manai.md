## Overview

Manai is the god of destruction, power, and wealth. He was not born of necessity or balance, but forged deliberately by the gods as a divine weapon. Where other forces brought famine, war, or decay, Manai was the siege engine aimed at the world itself, unleashed to break what could not otherwise be undone.

In his earliest purpose, Manai was destruction without restraint. Cities fell, immortals were unmade, and the foundations of the world were torn open beneath him. He was not sent to judge, teach, or correct. He was sent to end things.

From that devastation came accumulation. As Manai destroyed, he claimed what remained. Wealth, territory, power, and tribute gathered around him, not by design, but by instinct. Like all dragons, he hoarded. Over time, this hoarding became as central to his nature as destruction itself, giving rise to his dominion over greed, trade, and power. What he breaks, he keeps. What he keeps, he defends.

Manai is neither benevolent nor malevolent. He does not care whether what he destroys deserved to fall, only that it can fall. Likewise, he does not value wealth for morality or fairness, but for possession. To stand before Manai is to face the raw truth of existence: that everything can be taken, and that what remains belongs to whoever is strong enough to claim it.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Manai is depicted as a breathtakingly magnificent dragon of immense scale and presence. His form blends ferocity and majesty, crowned with sweeping horns that curve back from his head. His eyes shimmer like molten gold, reflecting both ancient knowledge and unrestrained hunger.

His body is covered in iridescent scales that shift through every hue imaginable, gleaming like a calm sea beneath a changing sky. Massive wings extend from his back, each beat scattering light and color across the world below. When unfurled, they are said to blot out the sun, casting a shadow that inspires equal measures of terror and awe.

Manai is often shown surrounded by treasure hoards of gold, jewels, and relics, symbols of both tribute and conquest. In many depictions, he soars above landscapes that contrast flourishing life with utter ruin, emphasizing his dominion over both prosperity and annihilation. Worshippers are shown kneeling or offering tribute, reinforcing that Manai’s favor is earned, not given.

## Goals

Manai does not pursue goals in the way other gods do. He does not seek balance, enlightenment, or cosmic harmony. His purpose is singular and instinctual: destruction followed by possession.

He exists to end things violently and decisively. When unleashed, Manai does not refine, test, or correct. He annihilates. Walls, empires, immortal orders, and divine works alike are reduced to ruin under his advance. Where others clean up what remains, Manai creates the wreckage.

After destruction comes hoarding. Wealth, tribute, and power flow toward him naturally, drawn by fear, awe, and inevitability. Trade arises in his wake not because he encourages it, but because survival demands negotiation with something that cannot be reasoned with. In this way, Manai becomes a god of commerce not through fairness, but through dominance.

Manai does not oppose permanence, nor does he protect it. If something endures after him, it does so because it was not yet broken. If it falls, that was always its fate. He is unconcerned with what rises afterward.

## Relationsihps

Manai’s relationships with the other gods are shaped by his origin as a divine weapon rather than a philosophical ideal. He was created to end things, not to debate them, and this has always set him apart from the pantheon. Even after accumulating wealth, dominion, and worship, Manai is still viewed by many gods as something unleashed rather than chosen.

He exists in constant tension with Cyrus. Cyrus represents restraint, judgment, and measured force, while Manai embodies overwhelming destruction brought to bear without negotiation. Though Manai does not reject justice outright, he views Cyrus’s insistence on limits as naive in the face of existential threats. Their conflict is often framed in myth as that of the dragon and the dragon-slayer, devastation versus duty. Neither truly hates the other, but both believe the other dangerously misunderstands power.

Manai’s relationship with Calypso is distant but respectful. He does not govern cycles, yet his destruction creates the conditions that allow cycles to begin anew. Calypso accepts his role as necessary but does not embrace it. To her, Manai is an interruption in time rather than a part of it. To Manai, time is irrelevant once annihilation begins.

He holds little in common with Castor, whose patience and watchfulness Manai finds unproductive. Castor, in turn, views Manai as a force that acts without reflection. Their domains rarely overlap, but when they do, it is in moments of catastrophe where wisdom and endurance struggle to contain devastation already in motion.

Manai has a wary respect for Solara. Both wield immense destructive power, but where Solara’s fire gives life as readily as it burns, Manai’s destruction leaves silence in its wake. He does not resent her, but he considers her restrained in a way he was never meant to be.

He shares an uneasy overlap with Rodikar. Rodikar glorifies conflict, victory, and struggle, while Manai views war as a means rather than an end. Battles are valuable only insofar as they lead to decisive ruin. Rodikar respects Manai’s might but rejects his indifference to honor and contest. Their followers often clash, especially when conquest gives way to annihilation.

Manai has little patience for Asmodeus’s schemes. While he recognizes the usefulness of infernal order, he despises manipulation that substitutes contracts and lies for raw power. To Manai, destruction should be honest. If something must fall, it should fall openly, not be tricked into collapse.

He has no true relationship with Komaku. Madness, dreams, and chaos are meaningless to him. Destruction born of confusion is wasteful, and the Abyss represents power without direction, the one thing Manai finds contemptible.

Manai’s relationship with Ukaleq is one of grim understanding. Where Manai ends civilizations, Ukaleq tends to the souls left behind. Death follows Manai inevitably, but it is not his concern. He does not linger on consequences, trusting Ukaleq to give shape to what remains.

Among the pantheon, Manai is respected, feared, and kept at arm’s length. He is not consulted lightly, and when he acts, gods and mortals alike understand that something irreversible is underway. Manai does not seek dominion over the other gods. He already proved his purpose once. Everything else he has claimed is simply what survived him.

## Myth and History

After the death of [[Ukaleq]], the gods feared that the world had grown too entrenched, too eternal, and too resistant to change. Mortality alone would not undo what had already been built. To solve this, the gods created Manai.

Manai was unleashed upon [[Faysel]] as an instrument of near-total destruction. He razed cities, shattered immortal strongholds, and tore through the works of gods and mortals alike. Wars, famine, and collapse followed in his wake, but those were consequences, not causes. Manai was the blow that broke the world open.

His advance ended in the lost city of [[Quoridon]], where a group of heroes confronted him. What occurred there is unclear. Some claim Manai was defeated. Others believe he was bound. Still others insist he simply stopped, his purpose fulfilled, leaving the rest to be scavenged and rebuilt by lesser forces.

What is known is that the world after Manai was irrevocably changed. Nothing built before him ever felt truly permanent again.
