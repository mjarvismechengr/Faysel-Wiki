## Overview

Asmodeus is the god of ambition, power, contracts, tyranny, indulgence, lies, and corruption. He is the supreme ruler of the Nine Hells and the greatest of all devils, known as the Lord of the Ninth and the Lord of Lies. From his throne at the deepest layer of Baator, he governs a vast infernal hierarchy built on law, suffering, and unbreakable obligation.

Asmodeus embodies lawful evil in its most absolute form. He is not driven by impulse or cruelty alone, but by structure, inevitability, and long design. His schemes unfold over centuries or millennia, spanning planes and civilizations. To him, the multiverse is a system to be perfected through control, and every soul is either a tool, a resource, or an obstacle.

Unlike many fiends, Asmodeus does not rule through rage or terror alone. He is a master orator and consummate statesman, soft-spoken, articulate, and unfailingly composed. He presents himself as reasonable, even generous, offering solutions where others offer despair. Those who accept his aid do so freely, bound by contracts that are precise, eternal, and devastating.

At the core of his philosophy is a belief that only absolute order can preserve existence. Chaos, sentimentality, and mercy are weaknesses that invite ruin. Asmodeus genuinely believes his rule would bring a perfect, stable cosmos, one in which every being has a defined place and purpose, enforced without exception. In his mind, tyranny is not cruelty but necessity.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Asmodeus is commonly depicted as a tall, handsome humanoid with crimson skin, a horned brow, and a perfectly groomed beard, standing over four meters in height. His eyes are said to glow with restrained ambition rather than fury. He dresses in opulent red and black garments of staggering value, symbols of wealth drawn from the suffering of countless souls.

Legends claim that beneath this composed exterior, his true form still bleeds acid-black blood from ancient wounds sustained during [[the Sundering]]. These injuries are said to cause him constant pain, though he never allows it to show.

In myth, Asmodeus defends his actions as lawful and necessary. He argues that his contracts are never broken, that souls are taken only by consent, and that his devils stand as the final bulwark against the endless destruction of the Abyss. Some theologians quietly admit that, in this single claim, he may be correct.

## Goals

Asmodeus’s foremost goal is the preservation of his absolute rule over the Nine Hells. From this foundation, he seeks to expand the influence of lawful evil across the planes, slowly reshaping the cosmic balance in his favor.

Beyond this, Asmodeus works toward a far greater ambition: the healing of the divine wounds he suffered during his ancient fall, the restoration of his full power, and the eventual unmaking of the current planar order. This apocalyptic vision would end the planes as they now exist and allow him to remake reality according to his design.

The engine of this ambition is souls. The Nine Hells are sustained by infernal energy derived from the damnation and systematic destruction of mortal identity. Through contracts, temptation, and indulgence, Asmodeus offers power, longevity, pleasure, and even resurrection. Every reward carries a precise cost, and all bargains end in eternal servitude.

Asmodeus advances his agenda on three primary fronts: the Blood War, infernal politics, and the corruption of faith. The Blood War serves as both justification and distraction, occupying his enemies while legitimizing Hell’s existence. Within Baator, he encourages constant rivalry among his archdevils, ensuring they spend their ambition fighting one another rather than him. Among mortals and gods, he sows doubt, rivalry, and disbelief, revealing divine pettiness and quietly undermining faith itself.

## Relationships

Asmodeus’s relationships with other deities are defined by ideology rather than sentiment. He does not hate blindly, but measures other gods by how useful, predictable, or obstructive they are to his vision of absolute order.

Good-aligned deities stand in open opposition to Asmodeus, though he views most of them with a mixture of contempt and amusement rather than hatred. To him, mercy and idealism are structural weaknesses that guarantee failure. Among them, Cyrus, god of law and justice, is a particular rival. Their conflicts are not fought with armies, but with rhetoric, doctrine, and philosophy. Asmodeus delights in challenging [[Cyrus]]’s belief that law and justice are inseparable, arguing instead that law is strongest when stripped of compassion. These clashes of ideology echo through mortal legal codes, oaths, and courts, where the line between justice and tyranny is often tested.

Asmodeus finds [[Thalia]], goddess of revelry, love, and art, deeply unsettling. Her joy is uncalculated, her goodness unstructured, and her resistance to tyranny rooted in shared experience and communal defiance rather than force. He struggles to comprehend how something so whimsical and emotionally driven can meaningfully oppose order, yet the quiet effectiveness of Thalia’s influence, particularly through groups like the [[Clandestine Choir]], frustrates him. Where Asmodeus controls through fear and obligation, Thalia inspires rebellion through hope, creativity, and shared humanity.

His most overt and violent rivalry is with [[Komaku]], whose descent into chaos ignited the Blood War. Though Asmodeus was instrumental in feeding Komaku’s paranoia and eventual madness, their conflict has since become absolute. Komaku represents everything Asmodeus despises: unrestrained chaos, destructive impulse, and power without discipline. The Blood War serves both as a genuine existential threat and a convenient justification for Asmodeus’s tyranny, allowing him to frame Hell as a necessary defense against annihilation.

Despite his role in manipulating events that led to [[Ukaleq]]’s death, Asmodeus and Ukaleq do not share open hostility. Ukaleq, god of death and the afterlife, does not hold Asmodeus personally responsible, viewing death as a natural and necessary force rather than a moral failing. This dispassionate stance frustrates Asmodeus, who prefers enemies burdened by guilt or anger, but it has prevented their relationship from devolving into outright enmity.

Among evil and shadow-aligned gods, Asmodeus maintains a complex web of rivalries, bargains, and temporary alliances. He shares certain aligned goals with [[Xalzotec]], particularly in the use of fear, corruption, and hidden influence, but distrusts the dark god’s obscurity and unpredictability. Where Asmodeus builds systems meant to endure, Xalzotec thrives in secrecy and decay, making him a useful but unreliable counterpart.

In general, Asmodeus regards other evil gods as competitors rather than comrades. Alliances are forged when necessary and broken without hesitation. He respects ambition, but only when it is disciplined, and views any god who claims power without structure as ultimately inferior. To Asmodeus, all gods are pieces on a board, some opposing him openly, others unknowingly advancing his designs.

## Myth and History

In the earliest age, when the gods still shaped Faysel directly, Asmodeus was counted among the chief creators of mortal life. Even then, he was ambitious and perceptive, watching for weakness among his peers. 

When his brother [[Komaku]] began to fracture under his own nature, Asmodeus exploited the moment, feeding his paranoia through careful whispers and subtle influence. This manipulation culminated in Komaku’s killing of [[Ukaleq]], an act that shocked the pantheon and triggered a cosmic unraveling that led to the Sundering. 

As the gods withdrew into grief and debate, Asmodeus remained undiscovered as the instigator. When Ukaleq returned and argued for the necessity of death and endings, Asmodeus supported the cleansing of Faysel and the creation of [[Manai]], recognizing immediately how mortal ambition could be weaponized through shortened lifespans. 

In the chaos that followed, Asmodeus flourished. He forged secret pacts with mortals seeking to escape death, powerlessness, or obscurity. His influence spread unchecked until Komaku’s first demonic incursion exposed his treachery and marked Asmodeus as a cosmic adversary rather than a fallen ally.
