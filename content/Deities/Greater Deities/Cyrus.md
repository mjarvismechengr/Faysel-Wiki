## Overview

Cyrus is worshipped as the god of law, justice, order, peace, honor, oaths, and leadership. He is revered as the grand arbiter and the ideal ruler, a divine example against which both humble town guards and sovereign monarchs measure themselves. To follow Cyrus is to believe that peace is not the absence of conflict, but the result of fair law faithfully upheld.

Cyrus teaches that order is a moral responsibility. Authority exists not to dominate, but to protect. Law exists not to constrain the righteous, but to restrain those who would harm others. In this way, Cyrus embodies justice as both shield and sword, defending the innocent while holding the guilty fully accountable.

He is widely respected even beyond his faithful, as his principles underpin courts, treaties, and codes of conduct across [[Faysel]]. Though stern, Cyrus is not cruel. His judgments are deliberate, measured, and final.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Cyrus is depicted as a tall, regal figure clad in gleaming armor, bearing a radiant, transparent sword and a sturdy shield. His blade is often shown as light given form, symbolizing truth made unavoidable. Whether crowned or helmeted, his expression is unwavering, his gaze resolute and assessing.

Artists portray him as calm rather than wrathful, conveying authority through stillness rather than force. His presence is said to inspire discipline, clarity, and resolve. In many depictions, his sword is held point-down in times of peace and raised only when justice must be enforced.

Cyrus is venerated as the embodiment of cosmic law, the force that ensures fairness does not yield to convenience or corruption.

## Goals

Cyrus’s primary goal is the preservation of just order. He seeks a world in which laws are clear, oaths are binding, and leadership is exercised with responsibility rather than indulgence. To Cyrus, peace is the natural outcome of justice consistently applied.

He works to strengthen institutions that uphold fairness, including courts, codes of law, and systems of governance. Mortals who lead with integrity, honor their word, and accept accountability often find Cyrus’s influence quietly supporting them, though rarely in overt or miraculous ways.

Cyrus is deeply opposed to deception, tyranny, and the abuse of authority. Those who twist law to shield themselves from consequence draw his attention more readily than open criminals. In his view, betrayal of trust is among the gravest offenses.

Unlike gods who seek expansion of worship or dominion, Cyrus seeks alignment. He does not demand devotion, but adherence to principle. Those who act justly honor him whether they invoke his name or not.

## Relationships

Cyrus is said to be the husband of Cyra and the father of Castor, Calypso, Asmodeus, Komaku, and Rambak. In creation myths, he is often portrayed as the stabilizing force within the divine family, providing structure and restraint to Cyra’s boundless creation.

His relationship with Asmodeus is one of profound and irreconcilable ideological opposition. Where Cyrus believes law exists to serve justice and preserve peace, Asmodeus believes law exists to enforce control and inevitability. Their conflicts are rarely fought with armies, instead unfolding as battles of doctrine, contracts, and moral argument. Cyrus represents principled restraint and accountability, while Asmodeus embodies calculated tyranny. Each views the other as a dangerous perversion of law, and their rivalry echoes constantly through mortal legal systems and codes of conduct.

Cyrus shares strong alignment with Castor, Solara, and Calypso, though for different reasons. With Castor, he finds common ground in vigilance, responsibility, and the long view of order. With Solara, he respects her role as a force of clarity and action, even when her burning passion outpaces his caution. With Calypso, he acknowledges the necessity of time, structure, and seasonal change, though he sometimes chafes at her acceptance of inevitability where he would prefer intervention.

His rivalry with Rodikar is fierce and deeply personal. Cyrus sees Rodikar as glorifying conflict for its own sake and mistaking victory for justice. Rodikar, in turn, views Cyrus as naive, hiding behind words instead of steel. Their clashes represent an ancient question that neither has answered definitively: whether peace is forged through righteous restraint or earned only through conquest. This rivalry fuels countless holy wars, duels, and philosophical schisms among their followers.

Cyrus also stands in opposition to Manai, though their conflict is less ideological and more existential. Manai embodies unchecked destruction and accumulation through force, while Cyrus believes power must be constrained by responsibility. Many myths cast Cyrus in the role of a divine dragon-slayer, standing against devastation not because it exists, but because it must be answered. He does not deny destruction’s role in renewal, but he rejects any claim that devastation alone justifies itself.

Toward Xalzotec, Cyrus feels outright condemnation. Secrecy, blood sacrifice, undeath, and subterfuge are anathema to his vision of law and justice. Where Xalzotec thrives in hidden power and unseen violence, Cyrus demands accountability and transparency. Their conflict is rarely subtle, and Cyrus’s followers are among the most aggressive in rooting out Xalzotec’s cults.

Cyrus holds deep disgust for Komaku. Madness, fear, and unrestrained chaos represent the complete collapse of law and responsibility. Komaku’s role in Ukaleq’s death and the devastation that followed stands, in Cyrus’s eyes, as proof of what happens when power is divorced entirely from restraint.

His relationship with Rambak is strained but not hostile. Cyrus respects kinship and protection of the natural world, but is wary of Rambak’s resistance to imposed order. To Cyrus, peace between people sometimes requires rules that the wild does not recognize. To Rambak, those same rules can fracture communities that once lived in harmony. Their tension reflects the divide between civilization and nature, neither wholly right nor wholly wrong.

Cyrus is also uneasy with Thalia. While he recognizes the value of joy, culture, and shared experience, he is deeply uncomfortable with her rejection of foresight and restraint. To him, unchecked indulgence risks chaos; to her, excessive order risks lifelessness. Though not enemies, their philosophies often clash in how societies choose to live.

Among the gods, Cyrus is one of the most openly opinionated, and he makes no effort to hide it. He believes that neutrality in the face of injustice is itself a failure of duty. This has earned him both deep reverence and quiet resentment within the pantheon. Even gods, in his eyes, are not above judgment.

## Myth and History

In the earliest myths, Cyra is said to have forged Cyrus as her companion, and together they brought structure to creation. While Cyra shaped matter and life, Cyrus defined boundaries, laws, and purpose. From their union came a family of gods who would shape the world further.

Many legends recount Cyrus walking among mortals as a leader, judge, or advocate. He appears as a commander inspiring soldiers to restraint, a lawyer dismantling lies through reason, or a mediator calming conflicts before they erupt into violence. These stories emphasize that justice begins with understanding, but ends with accountability.

Cyrus is perhaps best known in myth for his dealings with those who seek to evade justice. Traitors, oathbreakers, and corrupt officials find no mercy in his gaze. For them, Cyrus delivers what is known as [[Swift Justice]], an inescapable reckoning that arrives only after every chance for redemption has been exhausted.
