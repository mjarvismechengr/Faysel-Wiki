## Overview

Rodikar is the god of combat, war, conquest, competition, victory, and blood. One of the four mortals to ascend to godhood, he won his place through battle and believes that no position of power should ever be granted without proof. To Rodikar, destiny is not discovered, it is seized through skill, discipline, and violence.

Rodikar teaches that conflict is the truest measure of worth. War strips away pretense, revealing who is strong, who is clever, and who is willing to act. He rejects the notion that ideals alone shape the world. Only action does. Victory is not a moral question to Rodikar, but a factual one.

Unlike gods who embody abstract principles, Rodikar is deeply practical. He values tactics, preparation, adaptability, and the will to finish a fight.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Rodikar is depicted as a towering, imposing figure clad in battle-worn regalia marked by countless victories. His armor bears dents, cracks, and dried blood, each a record rather than a flaw. His face is concealed behind a helm, leaving only his burning eyes visible, fixed perpetually on his next challenge.

He wields the trident [[Sanguine Fury]], a weapon said to thirst for blood and resonate with the pulse of battle itself. In art, the trident is often shown slick with gore or planted firmly in the ground after a victory, symbolizing conquest made permanent.

Rodikar’s presence inspires courage, aggression, and rivalry. Where he walks, disputes escalate and champions rise. Even allies feel compelled to prove themselves in his shadow.

## Goals

Rodikar’s goal is simple and uncompromising: to ensure that power belongs only to those who can take and hold it. He believes the world advances through conflict, and that peace is not the absence of violence, but the outcome of decisive victory.

He seeks constant challenge, both for himself and others. Wars, duels, tournaments, and rivalries are not tragedies in his eyes, but opportunities to refine strength and strategy. A victory untested is meaningless, and a ruler unchallenged is unworthy.

Rodikar despises stagnation and inherited authority. Kings who rule by bloodline alone, gods who hide behind doctrine, and leaders who refuse to fight for their beliefs all draw his contempt. He respects even his enemies, provided they meet him openly and with intent.

Rodikar seeks competitors. Those who survive battle with honor, sharpen their skills, and continue to challenge themselves honor him whether or not they ever speak his name.

## Relationships

Rodikar holds open disdain for many gods in the pantheon, believing that too many of them represent ideals they have never truly tested. To him, divinity without struggle is hollow. Power that has not been earned through conflict is unproven, and philosophy without bloodshed is speculation at best.

His most vehement conflicts are with Pestilina and Xalzotec. Rodikar acknowledges that poison, disease, famine, and assassination are effective tools, but he rejects them as cowardly. To him, victory must be contested openly. A foe deserves the chance to fight back. Killing from the shadows or letting sickness do the work robs conflict of meaning and strips victory of honor. These disagreements are not philosophical curiosities but active, violent feuds played out through champions, wars, and purges.

Rodikar’s rivalry with Cyrus is equally deep, though rooted in contempt rather than method. Rodikar sees Cyrus as a pretender who speaks endlessly of peace while relying on others to shed blood to achieve it. In Rodikar’s view, peace is not negotiated, it is enforced by strength and maintained through readiness for violence. Cyrus, in turn, views Rodikar as dangerously short-sighted, mistaking dominance for justice. Their followers clash wherever law confronts conquest.

Despite this, Rodikar shares a begrudging respect for Iskandar. Both understand struggle, endurance, and the necessity of facing overwhelming force. Where Rodikar seeks decisive victory, Iskandar embraces survival through chaos. Their competitions are legendary and often end not in hatred, but in mutual recognition of strength.

Rodikar finds common cause, if not friendship, with Manai. Manai embodies annihilation on a scale Rodikar respects, though he finds Manai’s indifference to contest and honor troubling. Destruction without resistance feels empty to him. Still, when something must be utterly broken, Rodikar does not deny Manai’s usefulness.

He has little patience for Thalia, viewing her indulgence and celebration as distractions from the hard truths of existence. Yet even Rodikar cannot fully dismiss her. He recognizes that morale, passion, and shared stories can turn the tide of battle, even if he considers them secondary to steel and discipline.

Rodikar respects Nanuk as a fellow ascended god who proved himself through mortal struggle. Though their methods differ, Rodikar values Nanuk’s willingness to test himself against worthy prey and to live by the outcome. The hunt, to Rodikar, is simply war stripped to its purest form.

He is largely indifferent toward Calypso and Castor. Time, fate, and vigilance are realities he accepts but does not revere. Battles are fought in moments, not eras, and watching does not equate to acting.

Rodikar holds no fear of death and thus shows neither reverence nor resentment toward Ukaleq. Death is simply the final outcome of conflict. What matters is how one meets it.

Among the gods, Rodikar is unapologetically divisive. He does not seek consensus, balance, or harmony. He seeks proof. To stand against Rodikar is to be tested. To stand with him is to accept that peace is temporary, and only strength ensures survival.

## Myth and History

Rodikar was born among the first truly mortal generations of Faysel, raised in harsh conditions where survival demanded violence. He found clarity in combat, discovering early that conflict was the only place where the world made sense to him. From this came his guiding belief, often summarized as “peace in the violence.”

Throughout his mortal life, Rodikar traveled across Faysel, studying forms of combat, tactics, and warfare. While accounts of his journeys vary, all agree on one truth: every warrior, champion, and army that faced him fell. Victory followed him as naturally as breath.

Shortly before the Sundering, Rodikar challenged the existing god of war, a deity now erased from most histories. He offered a single bargain. If Rodikar lost, he would serve the god and fight in his name forever. If he won, he would take the god’s place.

The duel was brief. Forged by real bloodshed rather than divine abstraction, Rodikar overwhelmed the god and killed him. With that act, Rodikar ascended to godhood, claiming dominion not through inheritance, but through conquest.

Rodikar still honors that ancient bargain. Any mortal he deems worthy may challenge him in single combat. Defeat means lifelong service. Victory means ascension. None have yet succeeded.
