## Overview

Komaku is the god of sleep, dreams, fear, madness, nightmares, illusion, and chaos. His influence lies not in darkness itself, but in the mind when certainty dissolves. He dwells at the deepest reaches of the Abyss, where reality fractures under the weight of endless dreaming, and it is said that the plane and its demonic legions are born from his restless subconscious.

Komaku does not rule the Abyss through will or command. Instead, it exists as an extension of his dreaming mind. Nightmares given form, fears made manifest, and thoughts unbound by logic spill outward from him, shaping infinite layers of chaos. Whether Komaku dreams intentionally or is trapped in an unending state of fractured sleep is unknown.

To mortals, Komaku represents the terror of losing control over one’s own thoughts. He is the presence felt in recurring nightmares, intrusive fears, false perceptions, and the slow unraveling of sanity. Unlike gods of shadow or secrecy, Komaku does not hide truth. He distorts it.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Komaku is never depicted consistently, as no single form can contain him. He appears as fractured imagery drawn from dreams, half-remembered faces, distorted reflections, or figures that shift when observed too closely. Artists often describe him as impossible to finish, as though the act of defining him causes the image to fall apart.

When his eyes are described, they are not voids, but spirals of chaotic perception, overwhelming the viewer with overlapping thoughts, emotions, and false memories. His voice, when heard in myth or nightmare, is intimate and persuasive, speaking in reassurance rather than threat, promising understanding while quietly undermining certainty.

## Goals

Komaku does not pursue goals in any coherent or linear sense. His influence spreads through sleep, fear, and fractured thought rather than deliberate intent. He does not seek dominion, worship, or balance, and may not even be aware of the effects he has on the world.

Some believe Komaku dreams in an attempt to resolve his own broken mind, endlessly reshaping reality in search of something that feels whole. Others claim that his dreaming is purely instinctual, an uncontrolled process that generates chaos simply because it cannot do otherwise.

What is known is that the Abyss responds to Komaku’s mental state. When his nightmares intensify, demonic activity increases and reality fractures more violently. When his dreams grow quieter, the Abyss recedes, though it never truly rests.

Whether Komaku could ever awaken, be healed, or regain clarity is unknown. Many theologians fear that lucidity, rather than madness, would be the most catastrophic outcome of all.

## Relationships

Komaku is said to be the son of Cyra and Cyrus, and brother to Castor, Calypso, Asmodeus, and Rambak. These familial ties, however, hold little meaning to Komaku in his current state. Where once he may have been part of the divine family, he now exists largely apart from it, isolated by madness and the endless churn of dreams.

Komaku’s defining relationship is his absolute and eternal conflict with Asmodeus. Though Asmodeus helped shape Komaku’s descent by feeding his paranoia and fear, their opposition has long since transcended manipulation or blame. Komaku embodies chaos without direction, nightmares without purpose, and power without discipline. Asmodeus despises him not merely as an enemy, but as proof of what power becomes when unbound by structure. The Blood War is the physical manifestation of this philosophical divide, and neither god can disengage from it without risking annihilation.

Komaku holds no coherent stance toward most other gods. At times, fragments of his dreams brush against them, manifesting as visions, madness, or terror among their followers. These interactions are rarely intentional. Komaku does not scheme in the way Asmodeus does, nor does he seek worship in any traditional sense. Influence radiates from him involuntarily, bleeding into the minds of mortals and immortals alike.

He is regarded with deep unease by Castor and Calypso. Castor watches Komaku not as an enemy to be defeated, but as a warning, a reminder of what happens when vigilance fails. Calypso sees Komaku as a tragic aberration in the natural cycle, a mind caught in an endless, sleepless storm. Neither seeks to destroy him, though both acknowledge that he cannot be restored.

Cyrus views Komaku with outright condemnation. To him, Komaku represents the total collapse of responsibility and restraint. The murder of Ukaleq stands as an unforgivable crime, not because death itself is evil, but because it was inflicted through madness rather than judgment or necessity.

Komaku’s relationship with Ukaleq is unknowable. Some myths suggest that Ukaleq, upon his return, no longer regards Komaku with anger or fear, but with distant sorrow. Others claim that Komaku dreams endlessly of the moment of Ukaleq’s death, reliving it in distorted forms that birth new layers of the Abyss. Whether this is guilt, obsession, or simply another nightmare without meaning is unclear.

Komaku has no true alliances. Even other chaotic or shadow-aligned gods keep their distance, wary of becoming entangled in dreams that do not end. To interact with Komaku is to risk losing one’s own sense of self, as his domain does not negotiate, bargain, or forgive.

In the pantheon, Komaku is not a rival, nor a peer. He is a wound that never healed, a reminder that divinity does not guarantee sanity, and that some powers, once broken, cannot be contained, only endured.

## Myth and History

In early myths, Komaku was already described as unstable, prone to vivid dreams and distorted perceptions even before his fall. Where his siblings perceived creation through order, cycles, or purpose, Komaku experienced it as overwhelming and contradictory.

Asmodeus’s whispers did not create Komaku’s madness, but gave shape to his fears, feeding his paranoia until illusion became indistinguishable from truth. When Komaku killed Ukaleq, it was not an act of calculated malice, but one born of terror and misperception. The death of a god shattered the balance of life and death and marked the beginning of the Sundering.

Afterward, Komaku was cast into the Abyss, or perhaps collapsed inward and became its source. Since then, he has not acted as a god in the conventional sense, existing instead as a dreaming presence whose nightmares continue to warp reality.
