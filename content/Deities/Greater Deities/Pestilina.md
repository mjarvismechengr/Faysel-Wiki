## Overview

Pestilina governs affliction, poison, plagues, medicine, healing, famine, vermin, and serpents. She embodies the truth that suffering and survival are inseparable, and that life is often preserved through the same forces that destroy it. To Pestilina, disease is not a curse, but a mechanism, a pressure that tests bodies, populations, and civilizations.

She teaches that poison and medicine are the same substance viewed from different distances. What kills in one dose cures in another. What devastates a population can also harden it against future threats. Pestilina does not deny the horror of plagues, but neither does she condemn them. To her, inevitability is not cruelty, but honesty.

Like Nanuk and others who ascended from mortality, Pestilina retains a distinctly human fascination with her domain. She does not act from detachment, but from curiosity, obsession, and grim affection. She loves what she studies, even when it destroys those she touches.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Pestilina is depicted as an ominous and deeply unsettling figure, often appearing as a green, faintly scaled humanoid cloaked in tattered, writhing fabric. Beneath this living shroud crawl snakes, rats, spiders, and other vermin, occasionally visible as they shift beneath the cloth.

Her eyes glow a sickly yellow beneath her hood, slit like a serpent’s and heavy with scrutiny rather than rage. Her presence is said to wither crops, sour water, and leave the earth barren in her wake. Mortals fear her deeply, and even other gods regard her with unease.

In one hand, Pestilina carries a staff entwined with two living serpents. One delivers the deadliest venom known, while the other produces the most potent cures. In her other hand she bears a shallow bowl used to mix tinctures, antidotes, and plagues alike. Despite her horrific appearance, many myths show her kneeling beside the sick, brewing cures with the same care she once devoted to crafting disease.

## Goals

Pestilina seeks understanding through affliction, but she does not pursue it with neutrality. She believes suffering is both necessary and instructive, and she takes a grim satisfaction in watching life struggle beneath its weight. Disease, famine, and poison are not merely tools of study, but instruments of revelation.

She spreads plagues with intent. Some outbreaks are experiments, others are corrections, and a few are indulgences. Pestilina delights in watching populations thin, fracture, and adapt, observing which bodies endure, which minds innovate, and which societies collapse under pressure. The weak die. The clever learn. The resilient survive scarred but improved. All outcomes are useful.

Her malice is not spiteful, but selective. She has little interest in indiscriminate annihilation. Instead, she prefers prolonged trials that force adaptation. A swift death teaches nothing. A lingering sickness teaches everything.

Healing remains sacred to her, but it is not merciful. Cures are rewards, granted to those who prove interesting, persistent, or useful. Each recovery is both a triumph and a data point. Immunity is admired. Resistance is celebrated. Failure is recorded without remorse.

Pestilina does not seek worship so much as participation. To call upon her is to accept that survival will come at a cost, and that even success may leave lasting scars. She does not promise salvation, only the chance to endure.

## Relationships

As one of the four ascended gods, Pestilina holds little interest in the politics of the divine family. She did not inherit her station, nor does she feel bound by the rivalries and grievances of those who did. To her, survival, suffering, and adaptation are more honest forces than law or legacy.

She maintains a close and largely cooperative relationship with Rambak, as many of her poisons, cures, and alchemical discoveries are derived from plants within his domain. Though their philosophies differ, Rambak accepts her as a necessary part of the natural cycle, and Pestilina respects the raw, living sources of her craft.

Pestilina is also on good terms with Ukaleq. Disease, poison, and famine often serve as the threshold to his domain, and both gods view death not as a failure, but as an outcome. Where Ukaleq tends to what comes after, Pestilina concerns herself with the crucible that determines who reaches that end, and how.

Her relationship with Rodikar is openly hostile. Rodikar despises poison, plague, and famine as dishonorable methods of conflict, while Pestilina finds his fixation on glory and open battle wasteful and naive. Their feuds are violent, personal, and unrestrained, and their followers clash wherever war and disease intersect.

Pestilina’s relationship with Cyra is deeply conflicted. Cyra both reveres and loathes her. Pestilina is a healer, preserver, and innovator, but also an architect of suffering and mass death. Cyra does not deny Pestilina’s necessity, but the cost of her work weighs heavily on the goddess of creation, making their bond one of simultaneous respect and quiet revulsion.

She has worked willingly with Asmodeus on multiple occasions, lending her plagues, poisons, and expertise to his long-term schemes. Pestilina harbors no illusions about his nature, but sees no moral conflict in enabling suffering if it yields knowledge, adaptation, or power. Asmodeus, for his part, values her precision and detachment.

Pestilina holds little affection for Thalia. Thalia’s indulgence, optimism, and celebration strike Pestilina as frivolous and willfully blind to the realities of decay and mortality. Where Thalia encourages living in the moment, Pestilina reminds the world that moments end.

Her relationship with Cyrus is an uneasy alliance balanced on necessity. In many civilizations, Pestilina’s temples serve as hospitals, research halls, and places of last resort, operating under Cyrus’s protection. Yet famine and plague represent some of the greatest threats to his vision of order and peace. Their cooperation persists only so long as her work saves more lives than it ends.

Among the pantheon, Pestilina is both indispensable and feared. She is the god others turn to when survival demands sacrifice, and the god they blame when that sacrifice becomes unbearable. She does not seek love, forgiveness, or justification. She seeks results, and the truth that suffering reveals.

## Myth and History

During [[the Sundering]], the gods introduced plagues into the world for the first time. Among mortals, Pestilina was a physician and researcher who encountered these new afflictions not with revulsion, but fascination.

She studied disease obsessively, cataloging symptoms, refining transmission, and experimenting with potency. In doing so, she caused countless deaths, often under the belief that suffering was necessary to understand the limits of life. At the same time, she saved innumerable lives, developing cures and treatments that no one else could conceive.

To those she healed, she was a savior. To those she condemned through experimentation, she was a monster. Pestilina accepted both judgments without protest.

Her ascension came not through worship or divine favor, but through recognition. The gods saw that she had mastered affliction as thoroughly as any had mastered war, law, or creation. She stepped into divinity as she had lived, carrying plague and cure in equal measure, an open wound in the pantheon that none can comfortably ignore.
