## Overview

Nanuk embodies the unbridled spirit of the hunt and the primal reality of survival. He is the god of the hunt, animals, and endurance, representing life stripped of artifice, politics, or illusion. To Nanuk, existence is honest only when measured by skill, awareness, and the will to persist.

Unlike most of the gods, Nanuk ascended to divinity from mortality. His teachings reflect this origin. He does not preach harmony for its own sake, nor cruelty for sport. He teaches respect for prey, mastery of one’s body and instincts, and acceptance of the truth that life feeds upon life. To hunt is not to dominate nature, but to participate fully in it.

Nanuk is revered by hunters, rangers, nomads, and those who survive at the edge of civilization. He is indifferent to comfort, wealth, and power, caring only for capability. In his eyes, survival is the purest measure of worth.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Nanuk is often depicted as a towering, scarred figure with a powerful, weathered build shaped by countless hunts. He wears garments of animal pelts and bone, and his body is marked with intricate blue tattoos depicting every creature he has ever hunted or studied. In his hands he carries [[Unkhati]], a massive bow crafted from living wood and bone.

Nanuk is unique among the gods in that he appears as an animal as often as he does a humanoid. In all forms, his eyes glow softly green, a constant mark of his divine nature. The most common depictions show him as a colossal, scarred bear of terrifying strength, or as a massive elk with golden antlers, regal and watchful.

Artists and storytellers emphasize that no depiction is complete. Nanuk is never shown indoors, surrounded by luxury, or seated upon a throne. He is always moving, watching, or hunting.

## Goals

Nanuk’s purpose is to ensure that the hunt endures in all its forms. He does not seek balance, preservation, or restraint for their own sake. He seeks truth through pursuit, struggle, and survival. To Nanuk, life is defined by the contest between hunger and escape, strength and cunning, patience and panic.

He encourages mortals to answer the Call of the Wild by leaving comfort behind and testing themselves where certainty fails. Wilderness, danger, and scarcity are not evils to be corrected, but conditions under which true capability is revealed. Civilization dulls instinct. The hunt sharpens it.

Nanuk honors animals not as sacred innocents, but as fellow participants in the same struggle. Predator and prey are equals in the eyes of the hunt. Cunning, fear, aggression, and even waste are natural tools, not moral failings. Some creatures flee, some hoard, some kill beyond need. Nanuk does not judge these acts. They are expressions of survival.

What matters to Nanuk is engagement. To hunt is to commit fully, to risk failure, injury, or death. To be hunted is no less honorable. Strength is proven not through dominance alone, but through endurance, adaptation, and the will to continue.

Nanuk teaches mortals to embrace the beast within, to understand their instincts rather than deny them. Hunger, fear, and aggression are not weaknesses, but forces to be wielded. Only those who accept this truth, and survive by it, truly honor the hunt.

## Relationships

Nanuk is reclusive by nature, preferring the deep wilds of Faysel to the company of gods. He has no familial ties to the divine family and views their rivalries, ambitions, and grudges as little more than prolonged squabbles between beings too removed from the realities of survival. To Nanuk, power means nothing if it cannot be exercised alone, without witnesses or applause.

He maintains his closest relationship with Rambak, whose values he largely shares. Both revere the wild world and resist the encroachment of unchecked civilization. Where Rambak emphasizes kinship, community, and stewardship of the natural world, Nanuk embodies solitude, competition, and the unforgiving honesty of the hunt. They do not always agree, but they understand one another deeply. Rambak protects the forest. Nanuk tests those who enter it.

Nanuk holds a quiet respect for the other ascended gods, seeing in them proof that divinity can be earned rather than inherited. He respects Rodikar for his mastery of combat and willingness to prove himself through struggle, though Nanuk views open warfare as a blunt and wasteful expression of conflict compared to the precision of the hunt. He acknowledges Thalia for her authenticity and refusal to deny instinct, even if he finds her indulgence excessive and her celebrations noisy. In Pestilina, he recognizes a shared respect for endurance, venom, and adaptation, though he rejects the indiscriminate devastation of famine and plague as antithetical to the selective nature of the hunt.

Nanuk shares a philosophical alignment with Ukaleq. Death is not an enemy to Nanuk, but a certainty and a conclusion. He does not fear it, nor does he glorify it. The hunt ends when it must. Ukaleq’s calm stewardship of the dead aligns with Nanuk’s belief that death has a place and purpose, so long as it is not twisted into mockery through undeath.

He finds common ground with Calypso in the acceptance of natural cycles. Seasons change. Prey migrates. Populations rise and fall. Nanuk does not resist this rhythm, nor does he seek to control it. Where Calypso observes and governs the cycle, Nanuk lives within it.

Nanuk begrudgingly respects Asmodeus for his cunning and patience. A successful predator must understand leverage, deception, and timing. However, Nanuk despises coercion that relies on bondage and contracts rather than skill. Traps are fair. Cages are not.

His relationship with Xalzotec is similarly conflicted. Nanuk understands stealth, silence, and striking unseen. These are tools of the hunt. But where Nanuk hunts to test and survive, Xalzotec hides to corrupt and bleed. The method may look similar, but the intent could not be more different.

Nanuk has little patience for gods who impose their will on the wild without understanding it. He does not seek worship, nor does he intervene often. When he does, it is usually to remind mortals and gods alike that survival is not granted by law, love, or luck. It is earned, moment by moment, by those willing to face the world without shelter.

Among the pantheon, Nanuk stands apart. He is not neutral, but independent. He does not take sides. He takes aim.

## Myth and History

Unlike most gods, Nanuk was born mortal near the end of the [[Age of Wonder]]. Even among legendary heroes, his skill as a hunter was unmatched. He traveled the length of Faysel in search of worthy prey, refusing comfort, recognition, or command.

Nanuk hunted the [[Kami]], semi-divine nature spirits given physical form, not out of cruelty, but reverence. Each hunt was a test of skill, patience, and respect, and he came to value the elusiveness of his prey as much as the act of pursuit itself. His final quarry was [[Voragrim]], a titanic wolf whose capture marked the pinnacle of mortal hunting.

With no greater hunt remaining, Nanuk ascended to divinity as the god of the hunt. After his ascension, he resurrected the Kami, allowing them to roam [[Faysel]] once more. He declared that should any hunter succeed in hunting them all, with Nanuk himself as the final hunt, he would relinquish his divine mantle.

Many have tried. All have failed.
