## Overview

Cyra is believed to be the original deity of Faysel, existing before all others. Where later gods emerged from conflict, necessity, or change, Cyra is understood as the source from which divinity itself first flowed. The gods who followed are said to be either her direct creations or beings who arose in the wake of her work.

She is worshipped as the goddess of creation and family, revered not only by her faithful but often respected even by those who do not actively worship her. To many cultures, Cyra represents origin, connection, and continuity. She is also known as the smith of the gods, shaping existence through hammer and anvil, forging not only matter, but relationships, purpose, and lineage.

Cyra is widely regarded as benevolent and patient. She is not associated with conquest or dominion, but with beginnings and bonds. Where other gods impose their will upon the world, Cyra creates the conditions in which life and meaning can exist at all.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Cyra is most often depicted as a matronly dwarven figure, broad-shouldered and powerful, with warm eyes and a welcoming expression. Her presence is described as comforting rather than overwhelming, inspiring a sense of safety and belonging.

She is typically shown wearing a radiant breastplate marked with symbols of creation, ancestry, and craft. In her hands she bears a hammer, her primary instrument of creation. Unlike weapons wielded for destruction, Cyra’s hammer is shown mid-strike against an anvil, sparks flying outward to form stars, worlds, and living beings.

Myths place her divine forge at the heart of the cosmos, where the first matter was shaped and where new existence is still quietly born. In some traditions, every star is said to be a spark from her anvil, still glowing from the moment of creation.

## Goals

Cyra’s primary goal is preservation through creation. She seeks to ensure that existence continues, not as a static perfection, but as a living lineage of beings, ideas, and relationships. Where other gods shape fate, law, or conflict, Cyra concerns herself with making sure there is always something left to shape.

She values family in its broadest sense. Bloodlines, chosen bonds, communities, and shared labor are all expressions of her domain. Cyra encourages cooperation, teaching that creation is strongest when shared rather than hoarded.

Unlike many gods, Cyra does not seek expansion of her influence. She does not demand worship or obedience. Instead, she works quietly, trusting that life will naturally honor its source through continuation. When she intervenes, it is usually to preserve bonds rather than enforce outcomes.

Cyra is deeply opposed to annihilation and absolute endings. While she accepts change, decay, and death as necessary, she resists forces that seek to unmake creation entirely. To her, even flawed existence is preferable to perfect nothingness.

## Relationships

Cyra is said to be the wife of Cyrus and the mother of Castor, Calypso, Asmodeus, Komaku, and Rambak. These familial ties form the backbone of most creation myths, and Cyra is often described as the emotional and spiritual center of the divine family.

Cyra does not openly oppose her children, even when their ambitions turn inward against one another. In many myths, she is said to have forged weapons, armor, and tools for gods who would later use them in conflict. This is not portrayed as approval, but as an expression of her nature. Cyra creates. She does not withhold creation, even when it disgusts or pains her. To deny a creation is, to her, a greater betrayal than allowing its misuse.

She is said to grieve her children’s conflicts deeply. Some traditions claim that after witnessing the damage caused by divine ambition and rivalry, Cyra withdrew from direct guidance of the pantheon. Rather than rule or judge, she chose to create quietly, shaping the foundations of existence while allowing others to decide how those foundations would be used.

Her relationship with Ukaleq is one of the most complex and sorrowful in the pantheon. As the goddess of creation and family, Cyra mourned Ukaleq’s death more profoundly than any other god. Death was not an abstract concept to her, but the loss of a beloved being. Yet when Ukaleq returned from beyond and spoke of death as a necessary and even beautiful passage, Cyra did not oppose him. She disagreed, but did not deny his truth.

In myth, Cyra is said to accept death intellectually while rejecting it emotionally. She does not contest Ukaleq’s role as guide of souls, nor does she seek to undo the gift of mortality. Instead, she responds by creating more fiercely. More life. More bonds. More meaning. Where Ukaleq gives endings dignity, Cyra ensures beginnings are worth mourning.

Cyra holds no hatred for Asmodeus, despite his treachery, nor for Komaku, despite the devastation his madness wrought. This is often unsettling to other gods. Her love is not conditional, and her forgiveness is not a pardon. She does not excuse what was done. She simply refuses to unmake what she has made.

To mortals and gods alike, Cyra represents an uncomfortable truth. Creation does not choose sides. Love does not prevent harm. And even the most benevolent origin can give rise to terrible things. Cyra endures all of this not because she is blind to it, but because to stop creating would mean surrendering to despair.

## Myth and History

Though countless versions of [[Faysel]]’s creation myth exist, most share a common core. Cyra first forged Cyrus as a companion, and together they shaped the foundations of existence. From their union came a family of gods, each embodying aspects of the world and its workings.

These early gods are said to have created the sun and moon, organized the elements, and brought structure to the Material Plane. Cyra’s role was not command, but creation itself, providing the tools, matter, and relationships that allowed the world to take form.

Cyra is also credited with forging some of the most powerful objects ever known, including divine weapons, armor, and relics.

In many traditions, Cyra’s forge still burns. Though she no longer shapes the world openly, creation has not ceased. Children are born, stars ignite, and new bonds form every day, each a quiet echo of the first strike of her hammer.
