## Overview

Xalzotec is the god of night, sacrifice, secrets, stealth, subterfuge, blood, death, and undeath. His worship is outlawed in many lands, and even speaking his name is considered dangerous in polite society. This obscurity suits him. As the god of secrets, Xalzotec prefers to be known only in fragments.

Xalzotec does not rule openly. He waits in the margins of the world, in places untouched by [[Solara]]’s light, whispering to mortals who feel unseen, desperate, or ambitious. He promises power that does not fade, knowledge that is not shared, and existence beyond the limits imposed by death. Where other gods offer guidance, strength, or meaning, Xalzotec offers exemption.

He is not a god of madness or chaos. His influence is precise. Every secret kept, every blade drawn unseen, every life taken in ritual sacrifice strengthens him. He thrives where trust is broken quietly and where power is taken rather than earned.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Xalzotec is most often depicted as a colossal bat whose wings blot out the stars. His eyes burn crimson, said to pierce illusions, lies, and hidden intentions alike. Runes carved into his wings are believed to be written in blood, each symbol representing a pact, betrayal, or sacrifice offered in his name.

When he appears among mortals, Xalzotec takes a humanoid form cloaked in living shadow. His features retain unmistakable batlike traits, elongated ears, sharp fangs, and eyes that glow faintly red even in darkness. His voice is a whisper that seems to originate inside the listener’s mind, carrying truths they did not wish to confront.

Artists rarely portray Xalzotec directly. Most depictions are partial, a wing, an eye, a silhouette at the edge of torchlight. To show him fully is believed to invite his attention.

## Goals

Xalzotec seeks dominion through secrecy and corruption rather than conquest. His goal is not to end the world, but to hollow it out, replacing trust with suspicion and mortality with dependence. Every secret kept strengthens him. Every life preserved through undeath binds another soul to his influence.

He promotes sacrifice as proof of devotion. Power, in his view, must be paid for. Blood spilled willingly carries more weight than blood taken by force, and sacrifices made in desperation are especially potent. Through these acts, Xalzotec ensures that his followers are complicit in their own damnation.

Undeath is central to his ambitions. Unlike Ukaleq, who views death as a sacred transition, Xalzotec treats it as an obstacle to be subverted. By offering immortality through undeath, he traps souls in a state of dependence, cut off from the natural order and bound to his will.

Xalzotec does not seek mass worship. He prefers small, devoted cults, assassins, necromancers, and power seekers who operate unseen. His influence spreads quietly, and by the time it is noticed, the damage is already done.

## Relationships

Xalzotec exists at the margins of the pantheon by design. Where other gods assert presence through worship, doctrine, or open power, Xalzotec thrives in absence, secrecy, and denial. Many gods would prefer he not exist at all. Xalzotec prefers that they never be certain whether he does.

His most absolute opposition is with Solara. Where Solara reveals, Xalzotec conceals. Where she burns away corruption, he hides it, feeds it, and lets it rot unseen. Their conflict is not philosophical but existential. Solara’s light is one of the few forces that can truly disrupt Xalzotec’s influence, and he despises her for it. Cult purges, burned sanctuaries, and sudden disappearances of shadow cults are often the result of her direct intervention.

He is likewise opposed by Castor, though in a quieter, more patient way. Castor does not seek to banish night, only to watch it. Xalzotec resents this vigilance. The moon is not the sun, and new moons still come, but Castor’s Eye denies Xalzotec total obscurity. Where Xalzotec feeds on being unseen, Castor ensures the world is never entirely blind.

Xalzotec stands in fundamental violation of Ukaleq. Undeath, blood sacrifice, and the binding of souls are obscene to Ukaleq’s domain, and Xalzotec is the foremost practitioner of such perversions. Their conflict is absolute and irreconcilable. Where Ukaleq offers release and passage, Xalzotec offers stasis, hunger, and eternal bondage. No god opposes Xalzotec more completely than Ukaleq, even if that opposition is rarely visible.

His relationship with Asmodeus is one of uneasy alignment and mutual distrust. Both wield fear, corruption, and hidden influence, but their philosophies diverge sharply. Asmodeus builds systems meant to endure. Xalzotec erodes them from within. Asmodeus values contracts and structure. Xalzotec values silence and blood. They have worked toward overlapping goals in the past, but neither trusts the other, and any alliance between them is temporary and dangerous.

Xalzotec has little patience for Cyrus, whose insistence on transparency and accountability makes him a natural enemy. Cyrus represents the exposure of hidden crimes and the punishment of unseen evils. Xalzotec avoids direct confrontation with him, preferring instead to undermine legal systems through fear, disappearance, and corruption that leaves no clear culprit.

He shares a surface-level overlap with Nanuk in matters of stealth and unseen movement, but the similarity ends there. Nanuk hunts to test skill and survive. Xalzotec stalks to corrupt and consume. Nanuk disappears into the wild to live. Xalzotec disappears into shadow to feed. The two regard one another with wary understanding, but no respect.

Xalzotec is despised by Rambak, whose entire domain centers on connection, life, and shared bonds. Xalzotec severs families, isolates communities, and twists kinship into sacrifice. Where Rambak nurtures life, Xalzotec hollows it out.

He views Pestilina as a useful but dangerous neighbor. Disease weakens, but it also reveals. Pestilina’s work brings suffering into the open, while Xalzotec prefers pain hidden behind closed doors. They may cooperate briefly, but their methods ultimately clash.

Xalzotec has no rivalry with Rodikar, because Rodikar does not interest him. Open battle, honor, and glory are loud and wasteful. Wars draw attention. Xalzotec prefers the knife in the dark, the vanished child, the secret ritual no one admits happened.

He holds nothing but contempt for Thalia. Joy, shared story, and communal celebration are poison to his influence. Laughter exposes fear. Songs spread truth faster than whispers. Thalia’s followers undermine Xalzotec simply by refusing to suffer in silence.

Among the pantheon, Xalzotec is never central, never dominant, and never safe to ignore. He does not conquer realms or command armies. He waits in the spaces others refuse to look. And when gods and mortals alike pretend that some evils do not exist, Xalzotec ensures they endure.

## Myth and History

Little is known of Xalzotec’s origin, and what is known is deliberately obscured. Some myths claim he predates [[the Sundering]], existing as a shadow cast by the first light. Others insist he emerged afterward, born from the fear of death and the desire to escape it.

What is certain is that Xalzotec’s influence grew alongside undeath. As mortals began to seek ways to defy Ukaleq’s domain, Xalzotec answered. Vampires, liches, and other undead abominations are often linked to his whispers, whether knowingly or not.

Throughout history, secret cults devoted to Xalzotec have risen and fallen. Each follows a similar pattern. They promise protection, immortality, and forbidden knowledge. They demand sacrifice. Eventually, they collapse under paranoia, betrayal, or divine intervention, leaving behind ruins, cursed bloodlines, and unanswered questions.

Unlike other gods, Xalzotec rarely intervenes directly. He allows his followers to fail, believing that secrecy and ambition inevitably consume those who wield them. The survivors are sharper, colder, and far more dangerous.
