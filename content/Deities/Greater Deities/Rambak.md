## Overview

Rambak is the god of plants, the wild places of the world, the World Tree, and kinship. Known as the Oakfather, he teaches that all life is connected, whether by blood, root, soil, or shared struggle. To Rambak, family extends beyond peoples and nations to forests, rivers, and the land itself.

He offers welcome freely, extending patience and protection to mortals and creatures alike. This gentleness should not be mistaken for weakness. Those who despoil the natural world without restraint, or who deliberately sow hatred and division among the peoples of Faysel, invite Rambak’s wrath. When he acts in anger, it is slow, relentless, and deeply personal.

Rambak is widely regarded as one of the most approachable gods, especially among rural communities, travelers, and those who live close to the land. His presence is felt in sheltering groves, long-lived trees, and the quiet sense of belonging found in shared labor and shared meals.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Rambak is often depicted as an ancient bearded face emerging from bark, leaves, or drifting upon the wind through the forest. In some portrayals, his features appear briefly in the grain of a massive tree trunk before fading again into wood.

Other myths describe him as a colossal figure formed of roots, branches, vines, and moss, towering over forests while remaining indistinguishable from them at a distance. His eyes are deep green pools, and his voice is said to sound like wind moving through leaves or the creak of old branches under snow.

Artists rarely depict Rambak as fully separate from his surroundings. He is not shown standing upon nature, but within it, inseparable from the forests and wild growth he embodies. His presence is calming, radiating safety, patience, and quiet strength.

## Goals

Rambak’s goal is continuity through connection. He seeks to ensure that life, in all its forms, remains rooted to one another rather than fractured into isolation. Kinship, to Rambak, is the force that allows communities, ecosystems, and civilizations to survive across generations.

He does not oppose change, death, or hardship. Forests burn, plants wither, and wild lands shift. What Rambak resists is severance. The reckless destruction of land for short gain, or the deliberate breaking of bonds between peoples, threatens the long-term survival of the world itself.

Rambak encourages growth that respects its surroundings. Expansion is acceptable. Exploitation without care is not. He favors those who cultivate, replant, and protect even as they harvest.

Unlike Nanuk, who celebrates the contest of survival, Rambak values endurance through cooperation. Strength shared lasts longer than strength hoarded. His influence is subtle, working through tradition, shared memory, and the slow resilience of living systems rather than sudden intervention.

## Relationships

Rambak stands apart from the divine family not by distance, but by perspective. Where many gods define themselves through power, ideology, or ambition, Rambak defines himself through connection. He is less concerned with who rules than with who belongs.

Rambak maintains his closest bond with Nanuk. Though their temperaments differ, the two share a deep respect for the wild and its truths. Nanuk embodies the solitary hunt and the brutal honesty of survival, while Rambak represents kinship, shelter, and continuity. Where Nanuk tests the strength of individuals, Rambak protects the web that allows life to endure. They do not always agree, but they trust one another completely.

He shares a pragmatic and respectful relationship with Pestilina. Rambak provides the roots, herbs, and living systems from which her medicines and poisons are born. He does not condone her plagues, but he understands that decay and suffering are part of the world’s renewal. Where Pestilina experiments and refines, Rambak preserves and remembers.

Rambak finds common ground with Calypso. Both understand the long view of existence, the slow turning of cycles that outlast kingdoms and gods alike. Calypso governs the passage of time, while Rambak tends to what grows within it. Their alignment is quiet and enduring, marked by mutual respect rather than overt cooperation.

He is broadly aligned with Castor, whom Rambak views as a fellow watcher rather than a ruler. Castor lights paths and preserves stories, while Rambak offers refuge and belonging. Many myths place the two together as guardians of those who wander too far from civilization, one guiding them onward, the other welcoming them home.

Rambak’s relationship with Cyrus is strained but not hostile. Rambak respects the need for order among people, but distrusts systems that fracture communities or elevate law above compassion. He has little patience for laws that justify exploitation of land or people in the name of progress. Cyrus, in turn, sees Rambak as resistant to necessary structure, valuing tradition and kinship over enforceable peace.

He holds deep contempt for Asmodeus. Tyranny, enforced hierarchy, and bondage are antithetical to Rambak’s belief in mutual reliance and shared strength. Where Asmodeus seeks obedience, Rambak seeks belonging. Their domains rarely intersect directly, but when they do, it is usually over the fate of communities crushed beneath infernal ambition.

Rambak has little interaction with Manai, but views him with wary caution. Destruction can clear space for new growth, but Rambak knows too well that devastation without restraint leaves only scars. He does not oppose Manai outright, but neither does he forgive excess.

He openly despises Xalzotec. Blood sacrifice, undeath, and corruption of living bonds violate everything Rambak stands for. Where Rambak nurtures connection, Xalzotec severs it. Their followers clash wherever forests are defiled, families are broken, or life is twisted into mockery.

Rambak has little interest in the ambitions of gods like Rodikar, viewing endless conflict as a failure to protect one’s own. Victory means little if nothing living remains to share it.

Among the pantheon, Rambak is neither ruler nor rebel. He is the quiet constant, the god who remembers that no god stands alone, and that strength means nothing without something worth protecting.

## Myth and History

In the oldest stories, Rambak is said to have taken root in the world shortly after its shaping, binding the land together through vast unseen networks of root and vine. From this grew the World Tree, a symbolic and sometimes literal expression of his domain, representing the interconnectedness of all life on [[Faysel]].

During ages of great upheaval, Rambak is credited with sheltering survivors beneath forest canopies, preserving seeds and knowledge that allowed civilizations to rebuild. While other gods acted through conquest, law, or destruction, Rambak endured, quietly holding the world together until it was ready to grow again.

Many cultures tell stories of travelers lost in the wild who found refuge beneath an ancient tree, or feuding families reconciled during shared work in the fields. These tales rarely end with miracles. Instead, they end with survival, reconciliation, and the sense that something older and kinder was watching.
