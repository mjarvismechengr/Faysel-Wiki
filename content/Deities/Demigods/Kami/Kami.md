## Overview

Kami are semi-divine nature spirits embodied by animals, born of the wild places of Faysel. Each kami represents an aspect of the Hunt; predator or prey, pursuit or escape, patience or fury. Together they form the mythic backbone of Nanuk’s dominion.

In the age before his ascension, the great hunter [[Nanuk]] scoured the world in search of worthy quarry. One by one, the kami were hunted, captured, or slain, until none remained. When Nanuk ascended to godhood, he resurrected them—not as punishment, but as covenant. The Hunt would never again end.

Kami are immortal spirits. They can be slain, but never truly destroyed. In time, each reincarnates somewhere within its favored biome, changed subtly by memory and myth, yet unmistakably the same being. They roam the world freely, revered by Nanuk’s faithful and hunted by mortals who seek his favor, or dare to believe they could one day take his mantle.

To hunt a kami is to challenge the god of the Hunt himself.

## Art and Myth

The most enduring stories speak of the Thirteen Kami of the Wild Hunt, said to embody every truth of predator and prey. In these myths, Nanuk did not simply kill the kami, he _learned_ from them. Each hunt taught him something essential: patience, mercy, endurance, terror, cunning, inevitability.

When the final kami fell, the world itself is said to have gone silent. Only after Nanuk’s ascension did the forest breathe again, the rivers stir, and the winds howl, signaling the kami’s return and the rebirth of the eternal Hunt.

Shrines, cave paintings, and oral traditions often depict the kami in motion: often mid-stride, mid-strike, or mid-escape.
