## Overview

Og’riq is a demigod of tyranny and evil, revered and feared by those who seek power through oppression, control, and fear. He embodies domination in its purest form, believing that strength grants the right to rule and that weakness exists solely to be exploited. To Og’riq, order is not built through cooperation, but through submission.

Unlike many tyrants, Og’riq is deliberate and patient. He rarely acts in haste, preferring to rot institutions from within before moving openly. He thrives on corruption, coercion, and betrayal, engineering collapse long before he ever claims a throne. Where kingdoms fall apart under internal pressure, Og’riq is often found waiting at the edge, chains ready.

Og’riq remains bound to the [[Material Plane]], ruling from a black fortress in the frozen reaches of [[Isomar]]. Once far more powerful, he now controls only a fraction of the lands he once dominated. Though diminished, he continues to amass influence, believing that tyranny, properly applied, will eventually restore him to greatness.

### Depictions in Art and Myth

Og’riq is most often depicted as a towering figure of shadow and iron, seated upon a jagged throne. Heavy chains drape over his body like a mantle, some broken, others locked tightly in place. His form is cracked with faint molten red light, as though a hellish forge still burns within him.

His voice is said to echo like clashing metal, carrying an unnatural weight that presses obedience into the minds of those who hear it. His eyes glow like molten steel, piercing darkness and stripping away defiance. In all depictions, Og’riq is shown seated or enthroned, never standing among equals.

## Goals

Og’riq’s primary goal is restoration. Long ago, he suffered a catastrophic defeat that shattered his empire and reduced him from a near-god to a demigod clinging to survival. Since then, every conquest, alliance, and act of cruelty has served a single purpose: reclaiming his former dominion.

He seeks to expand his influence slowly, prioritizing control over territory rather than raw expansion. Og’riq prefers vassals to allies and enslaved rulers to conquered ruins. Through fear, magical bindings, and strategic corruption, he aims to rebuild a kingdom that cannot rebel because it no longer remembers how.

## Relationships

Og’riq exists in uneasy alignment with greater powers of tyranny and domination, particularly [[Asmodeus]]. While Og’riq lacks the infernal lord’s cosmic reach, he openly models his rule after infernal hierarchy and enforced obedience. Asmodeus views Og’riq as useful but expendable, a tyrant whose ambition exceeds his station.

He stands in direct opposition to [[Cyrus]] and [[Solara]]. Cyrus represents justice without fear, which Og’riq considers a lie, while Solara inspires rebellion and hope, forces Og’riq actively works to crush. Temples of both faiths are frequent targets of his raids and purges.

Og’riq has little patience for gods of chaos or indulgence. He despises [[Thalia]], whose joy undermines fear, and has no respect for [[Rodikar]], whose honor-bound violence Og’riq sees as wasteful and inefficient.

His relationship with [[Daghor Malatok]] is defined by hatred and rivalry.

## Myth and History

Og’riq once ruled a brutal empire across large portions of Isomar, enforcing obedience through terror, magical enslavement, and the infamous [[Shackles of Supremacy]]. These relics allowed him to bind rulers, champions, and even powerful spellcasters to his will, turning entire nations into extensions of his throne.

Legendary were the wars between Og’riq and Daghor Malatok. Where Og’riq ruled through domination and fear, Daghor sought control through undeath and knowledge. Their conflict devastated regions of Isomar and ended in Og’riq’s near destruction. Stripped of much of his power and territory, Og’riq retreated north, where he fortified himself in the frozen wastes.

Though diminished, Og’riq has never accepted defeat. His chains remain unbroken, his hatred undimmed, and his ambition intact. To many scholars, Og’riq represents a warning: that tyranny does not need to be victorious to remain dangerous. It only needs to endure.
