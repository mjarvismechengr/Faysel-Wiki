## Overview 

The Mangchida Ocean stretches across much of the southern and western world, lying south of [[Tekislar]] and west of [[Aequitorra]]. It borders the [[Tiber Ocean]] and [[Nagaru Ocean]] to the east and serves as one of the largest and least understood bodies of water on [[Faysel]].

Its vastness and isolation have limited exploration, and much of the ocean remains uncharted. Storm systems form far from land and drift unpredictably, while strange currents pull ships off known routes. Though believed to be empty save for scattered islands and open water, scholars quietly speculate that the Mangchida hides something vast and deliberately forgotten.
