## Overview 

The Tiber Ocean lies east of [[Isomar]], [[Al'Dira]], and [[Wanakona]], bordered by the [[Sky Razor Range]] along much of its western coastline and the sparsely inhabited western reaches of [[Tekislar]] to the east. Though vast, it connects comparatively little settled land, limiting its importance in global trade and travel.

Few major ports face the Tiber, as the mountains of Isomar and Al’Dira form a natural barrier between inland populations and the coast. On the opposite shore, Tekislar’s western regions are lightly populated and difficult to reach, offering little incentive for sustained maritime routes. As a result, the Tiber remains one of the least traveled oceans on the planet.

Sailors who do venture into the Tiber describe it as monotonous, with long stretches of open water and little in the way of landmarks or traffic. Storms occur, but generally its greatest danger lies in isolation. Ships that vanish here often do so without witnesses or trace.

Among navigators, the Tiber Ocean is regarded as a sea without purpose, bypassed in favor of more profitable and better-connected waters. Its emptiness has allowed myths to grow unchecked, and some believe that what little does move beneath its surface does so unseen and undisturbed.
