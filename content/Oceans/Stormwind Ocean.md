## Overview 

The Stormwind Ocean dominates the northern reaches of the world, its waters caught between [[Tekislar]] to the west and [[Dimaheim]] and [[Yoseju]] to the east. Cold currents and relentless winds define the region, giving the ocean its name and reputation. To the south and southeast it brushes the northwestern edge of [[Aequitorra]], while to the southwest it gradually blends into the warmer [[Mangchida Ocean]].

Though notoriously dangerous due to powerful winds and frequent storms, the Stormwind Ocean is well understood and regularly sailed. Its hazards are expected rather than mysterious, and generations of sailors have learned to work with its rhythms. As a result, the Stormwind is viewed not as a barrier, but as a proving ground for naval skill and endurance.
