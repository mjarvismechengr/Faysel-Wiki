## Overview 

The Nagaru Ocean spans the southern reaches of the known world and, despite its isolation, is among the most frequently traversed oceans on Faysel. Major civilizations along the southern coasts of [[Aequitorra]], [[Al’Dira]], and [[Wanakona]] rely on it for trade, migration, and naval movement, making its waters familiar to seasoned sailors.

The Nagaru is generally colder than other oceans, its deep currents carrying chill water across vast distances. Storms are less frequent than in the [[Stormwind Ocean]], but the cold, long swells, and immense distances between ports make travel unforgiving. To many, the Nagaru represents endurance rather than chaos, rewarding preparation and punishing complacency.
