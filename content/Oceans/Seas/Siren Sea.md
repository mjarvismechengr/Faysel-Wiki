## Overview 

The [[Siren Sea]] is enclosed by land on nearly all sides, bordered by [[Yoseju]] to the west, [[Isomar]] to the east, [[Dimaheim]] to the north, and the [[Sunset Sea]] to the south. This geography has made it one of the most strategically important seas in the world.

Trade, warfare, and cultural exchange converge here, and nearly every coastal power maintains a presence along its shores. Despite its importance, the Siren Sea has earned a darker reputation due to treacherous reefs, sudden storms, and persistent legends of voices and visions that lure ships off course.
