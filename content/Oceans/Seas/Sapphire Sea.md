## Overview 

The Sapphire Sea is a large inland sea located within [[Tekislar]], fed by waterways that ultimately connect it to the [[Stormwind Ocean]]. Surrounded by fertile coastlines and temperate climates, it serves as the cultural and economic heart of the continent.

Civilizations around the Sapphire Sea are densely populated and deeply interconnected, with trade, warfare, and diplomacy all flowing across its waters. Compared to the surrounding wilds of Tekislar, the region feels orderly and ancient, shaped by centuries of naval dominance and shared history. Many consider the Sapphire Sea the cradle of Tekislar’s greatest empire.
