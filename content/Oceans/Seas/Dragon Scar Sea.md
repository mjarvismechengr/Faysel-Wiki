## Overview 

The Dragon Scar Sea is a massive inlet along the southeastern coast of [[Al'Dira]], cutting directly through the [[Sky Razor Range]]. According to legend, [[Wanakona]] was once part of Al’Dira until the gods tore the land away to create [[Manai]], leaving the sea as a permanent wound in the world.

The surrounding waters are deep and unstable, with sheer cliffs, violent tides, and frequent seismic activity. To many cultures, the Dragon Scar Sea is considered sacred, cursed, or both, and it stands as one of the clearest reminders that the gods once reshaped the world by force.
