## Overview 

The Stovlok Sea is a large inland sea located in eastern [[Isomar]], formed by centuries of runoff from the [[Sky Razor Range]]. Fed by glaciers, rivers, and seasonal floods, it is cold, deep, and rich in life.

The sea supports numerous settlements along its shores and serves as a vital resource for agriculture, trade, and transport within the continent. Despite its utility, the Stovlok is known for sudden fogs and treacherous currents near its center, where the depth drops sharply and the water grows unnervingly still.
