## Overview 

The Sunset Sea lies between [[Aequitorra]] and [[Al'Dira]] and functions as a major regional sea rather than a true ocean. Its waters are relatively accessible and heavily trafficked, forming a vital corridor for commerce, migration, and conflict between the two continents.

While calmer than the open oceans, the Sunset Sea is politically volatile. Competing interests, piracy, and shifting alliances make its waters dangerous in ways that have little to do with weather. Control of its ports and islands has long been a source of tension, and few ships travel its length without encountering some form of scrutiny or threat.
