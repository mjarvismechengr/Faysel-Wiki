## Overview 

The Blood Sea is a warm, island-choked sea that lies along the eastern coast of [[Aequitorra]], enclosed by dense archipelagos and reef systems. Though geographically adjacent to the [[Sunset Sea]], it is culturally and politically distinct, functioning as its own maritime region.

The Blood Sea is infamous for piracy, smuggling, and independent island powers. Countless hidden coves and narrow channels make centralized control nearly impossible, allowing pirate havens and black markets to flourish. Trade moves quickly here, but rarely safely, and the line between merchant and raider is often thin. To sailors, the Blood Sea promises wealth, freedom, and violence in equal measure.
