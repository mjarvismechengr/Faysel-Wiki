Five volumes, bound in sky-blue leather with copper trim, their titles impressed in faintly shimmering black ink. Despite their pristine covers, the interior pages are brittle, spotted with ancient bloodstains and ash burns. These books are known collectively as _Skies of Sulfur_. Each tome contains rituals, visions, and philosophies tied to necromancy, planar heresy, and blasphemous echoes of divine liturgy. The language alternates between a variety of languages including Infernal, Deep Speech, Abyssal, Celestial, Draconic, and an archaic dialect of Common.
