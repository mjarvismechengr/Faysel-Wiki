Though it is written in Common, the book is too profound and recondite a work to be fully understood by anyone other than the appropriate specialist, but a character might be able to deduce the general subject matter. Gaining that knowledge requires 8 hours of study and a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The book contains instructions for the creation of a “philosopher’s stone,” then describes how that object can be used to convert base metal into gold.
