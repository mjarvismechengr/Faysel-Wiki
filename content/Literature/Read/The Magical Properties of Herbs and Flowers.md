This leather-bound, herb-scented volume is a comprehensive guide to flora used in alchemy and spellcasting. Written in Gnomish by the long dead wizard [[Thaequim]], the book is both a botanical study and a manual for practical magic. Chapters include:

- **Sacred Blooms:** Flowers like nightshade and lotus, their mystical energies, and their role in ritual magic.
- **Roots of Power:** The hidden magical potential of plants like mandrake and valerian root.
- **Seasonal Magic:** How the potency of herbs varies with the time of year and moon phases.
- **Potions and Poultices:** Recipes for potions that heal, harm, or enhance abilities, using herbs like lavender, wolfsbane, and belladonna.

The book includes pressed flowers and sketches of various plants, with annotations warning about toxic species and their potential side effects.
