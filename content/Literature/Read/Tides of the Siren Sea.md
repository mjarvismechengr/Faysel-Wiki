Tides of the Siren Sea is a practical naval almanac cataloging tide cycles, seasonal shifts, and notable anomalies along every coastline bordering the [[Siren Sea]], with particular detail given to the [[Siren Coast]].

The book is written for sailors, navigators, and harbor masters rather than scholars. Entries are methodical and consistent, allowing a reader to quickly learn how the tome is structured and how to locate information for a specific stretch of coast. Marginal notes reference storm seasons, unreliable currents, and regions where tides behave “out of character,” though no explanations are offered.

After 4 hours of study, the reader gains a reliable understanding of:

- General tidal patterns along the Siren Coast
    
- How tides shift with seasons and storms
    
- How to quickly reference specific coastal regions without further study
    

No skill check is required. The value of the book lies in preparation and foresight rather than hidden lore, making it a trusted tool aboard ships that survive longer than most.
