[[The Severed Veil - Curses and Afflictions]] is a A broad catalog of curses, magical afflictions, and their various treatments. Subjects include lycanthropy, vampirism, hag pacts, infernal bindings, and possession. Each entry discusses both the symptoms and known methods of mitigation or removal, though many solutions are partial or speculative. The work repeatedly stresses that curses and supernatural maladies are rarely uniform. Even afflictions sharing a name can differ wildly depending on origin, intent, and the will behind them. Many chapters end without definitive answers, only probabilities and warnings.

    - Divine intervention, destruction of a progenitor, or major ritual cleansing may be required for full cures of most afflictions.
