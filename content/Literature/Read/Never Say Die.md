Never Say Die is the first written work of [[Dotrice]].

The book is intended to become a living chronicle of Dotrice’s life on the road: heroic deeds, close calls, foolish decisions, unforgettable companions, and the stories gathered along the way. Dotrice writes not just to record events, but to _shape_ them, retelling moments with flair, humor, and just enough embellishment to make them worth remembering.

For now, Never Say Die remains a work in progress. Its pages are unevenly filled, jumping between rough notes, full chapters, song lyrics, overheard dialogue, and personal reflections. Some entries read like tavern tales meant to be performed, while others are quieter, more introspective thoughts never meant for an audience.

As the journey continues, the book is expected to grow alongside its author, slowly transforming from scattered notes into a true adventurer’s saga; one that insists, above all else, that no story is finished until its heroes are.
