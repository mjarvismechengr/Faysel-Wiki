Oldport’s Bay Floor Map is a carefully marked nautical chart recovered from a hidden compartment within Widow’s Light Lighthouse. At first glance it resembles a salvage or hazard map, but closer study reveals deliberate intent behind every marking.

The map charts the seabed of [[Oldport]]’s bay in unusual detail, noting currents, depth changes, and the precise locations of dozens of shipwrecks across different eras. Many of the wrecks correspond to known historical losses, while others have no surviving record, suggesting ships that vanished without witnesses or explanation.

At the center of the bay, circled repeatedly in red ink and annotated in cramped, nervous handwriting, is a region labeled with warning glyphs and directional arrows. This marks "below the chain’s reach," the resting place of what later notes refer to as "[[the Thing Beneath]]."
