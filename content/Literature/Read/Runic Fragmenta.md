Runic Fragmenta is a weathered folio containing diagrams, sketches, and incomplete studies of ancient rune systems. Its pages cover dwarven, giant, celestial, and draconic sigils, often presented side by side for comparison. The author or authors appear less concerned with cataloging complete alphabets and more interested in how runes change meaning based on context, placement, and intent.

Much of the text focuses on the idea that runes are not single-purpose symbols. A single glyph can represent physical strength, destiny, authority, protection, or binding magic depending on how it is framed and combined with others. Marginal notes speculate that many modern enchantments unknowingly reuse fragments of these older systems, stripped of their original depth.

A careful reader comes away with the sense that runic magic is one of the oldest and most interconnected arcane traditions in the world, and that much of its true power has been lost, misused, or forgotten rather than destroyed.
