Odium’s Book is a heavily used, gilded tome written in a mixture of Terran and Infernal. Its pages are worn, annotated, and marked by repeated handling, suggesting it has been consulted often rather than preserved. The text is dense but deliberate, favoring poetic incantation over explanation. Reading the book requires only about ten minutes, yet its implications are vast.

The author never names the subjects of its rituals directly. Instead, the book relies on metaphor, omission, and symbolic language, assuming the reader either already understands the references or is dangerous enough to piece them together. In this way, the book functions less as a manual and more as a key, pointing toward greater workings already set in motion.

## Incantation 1

> _"Where the bones of mountains stir,  
> And the breath of the deep still boils,  
> There lies the beast in silence. Not slain, but folded.  
> Wrought of root and stone, clothed in forest and fault,  
> Chained by name unspoken, will unwilled, law unwritten.  
> Let this rite be spoken where the ley is strongest,  
> And the wound of the world shall bleed forth power anew._”

## Incantation 2

> _“Seven seals for seven sins,  
> Seven keys for one who would not kneel.  
> The oath-breaker king, draped in silence and rot,  
> Sleeps in the city that swallowed its name.  
> Each lock bears a price:  
> A blade not drawn.  
> A vow unspoken.  
> A crown surrendered.  
> A fire drowned.  
> A sin relived.  
> A name unwound.  
> A silence kept.”_
>
> _“He dreams beneath the black water still,  
> And only when the seventh key sings  
> Shall his tomb breathe once more.”_
