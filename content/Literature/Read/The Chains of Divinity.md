The Chains of Divinity is a dense and unsettling treatise examining the rise, reign, and lingering influence of [[Og'riq]], the demigod of tyranny. Written in a cold, analytical tone, the work dissects domination not as madness or cruelty, but as a deliberate system of control refined over centuries.

The tome traces Og’riq’s consolidation of power across [[Isomar]], detailing how he dismantled governments from within before openly conquering them. Particular attention is paid to his use of magical coercion, fear-based governance, and ritualized obedience. Entire chapters are devoted to his divine artifacts, most notably the [[Shackles of Supremacy]], which the author describes as instruments capable of binding not only bodies, but will itself.

Interspersed throughout the historical analysis are ominous marginal notes and half-erased warnings suggesting that Og’riq’s defeat was incomplete. The author implies that tyranny, once embodied, cannot be fully destroyed, only diminished, contained, and forgotten until it is ready to return.

The work is attributed to an anonymous scholar. Linguistic analysis suggests the author was either writing in fear of reprisal or deliberately obscuring their identity to prevent the text from being suppressed or destroyed.
