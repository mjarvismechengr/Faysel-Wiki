The Stilltongue Alchemist is a utilitarian alchemical manual. The text favors clear procedures, careful purification, and warnings written in a clipped, almost ascetic tone. Marginal notes suggest the author revised recipes repeatedly to remove unnecessary risks. Many entries concern slowing curses, stabilizing magical conditions, or reducing the symptoms of ongoing afflictions instead of curing them outright. It is especially valued by hedge alchemists, plague-doctors, and ritualists who work at the edge of divine and arcane practice.
